## 3 Mechanical Weathering Processes that Break Down
nbsp 0183 32 Mechanical weathering is the breakdown of rocks into sediments through physical means For example weathering can carve out potholes in our streets break down rocks to form soils and even tear down mountains The major types of mechanical weatheringGeology of Englandnbsp 0183 32 The geology of England is mainly sedimentary The youngest rocks are in the south east around London progressing in age in a north westerly direction The Tees Exe line marks the division between younger softer and low lying rocks in the south east and the generally older and harder rocks of the north and west which give rise to higher relief in those regions

## What Is Spalling and How Can You Identify It
nbsp 0183 32 Spalling usually occurs for one of three reasons or sometimes a combination of these reasons Salt particularly the sodium chloride that s used on frozen roads in many northern states can result in oxidation or rusting of reinforcing steel when it s repeatedly introduced to a surface or buildingGeoconservation principles and protected areanbsp 0183 32 If the geomorphological processes that maintain habitat condition change then conservation targets may no longer be viable in some protected areas This may mean that the protected area status can no longer be justified or that site boundaries may need

## How Do Sedimentary Rocks Form
nbsp 0183 32 Sedimentary rocks like shale limestone and sandstone form from pre existing rocks If you start with sand mud or organic material these sediment deposits get eroded and transported over time This happens because shorelines move back and forth compacting material below like a steam rollerThe Brain Broca s and Wernicke s Areas and the Circle ofnbsp 0183 32 Both areas are important in producing intelligible speech This language loop is found in the left hemisphere in about 90 of right handed persons and 70 of left handed persons language being one of the functions that is performed asymmetrically in the brain

## Sedimentary rock
nbsp 0183 32 Sedimentary rocks are rocks formed from sediment They are deposited over time and often show layers which can be seen in cliffs Other types of rock are igneous rock and metamorphic rock Sediments are usually formed from matter which falls to the bottom of oceans and lakes The matter includes tiny pieces of other rocks and dead animalsMarble Rock Geology Properties Usesnbsp 0183 32 Marble is a metamorphic stone formed by subjecting limestone to heat or pressure In pure form marble consists of calcium carbonate calcite and is sparkling white Impurities produce pale gray brown or variegated colored rock Black marble also occurs
