## Ball mill
A ball mill,a type of grinder,is a cylindrical device used in grinding (or mixing) materials like ores,chemicals,ceramic raw materials and paints.Ball mills rotate around a horizontal axis,partially filled with the material to be ground plus the grinding medium.Different materials are used as media,including ceramic balls,flint pebbles and stainless steel balls.Gearless mill drives2 GEARLESS MILL DES The gearless mill drive eliminates ring gear,pinion,gearbox,coupling,motor shaft and motor bearings,used within a conventional mill drive system.By mounting the rotor poles directly onto the mill,the mill itself becomes the …
