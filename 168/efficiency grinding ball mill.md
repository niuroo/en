## The hardness of grinding media ball
But in the wet mill,the use efficiency of grinding media ball far exceeds the dry grinding operation,so the wear resistant grinding media ball in the wet grinding wear is lower.Look at the properties of wear resistant grinding media balls and the type of mill.Chromium is easy to be corroded and lost in the processing of wear resistant.The operating principle of the ball millThe operating principle of the ball mill consists of following steps.In a continuously operating ball mill,feed material fed through the central hole one of the caps into the drum and moves therealong,being exposed by grinding media.The material grinding occurs during impact falling grinding balls and abrasion the particles between the balls.
