Any existing open space between mineral grains in a rock can potentially contain a fluid.This fluid is mostly H 2 O,but contains dissolved ions.The fluid phase is important because chemical reactions that involve changing a solid mineral into a new solid mineral can be greatly speeded up by having dissolved ions transported by the fluid.

## Rocks and Minerals Facts
Interesting Facts about Rocks and Minerals.A rock is a solid substance that occurs naturally due to geological process of solidification,sedimentation and metamorphism.Every rock is made up of various minerals.However,a mineral is an inorganic solid that has one chemical composition.The structure of a rock is not uniform.Rock Cycle Process SciencingAny rock cycle explanation needs to begin with the three major types or families of rocks: igneous,sedimentary and metamorphic.Igneous rock forms when magma molten rock cools and solidifies.This rock forming process may occur underground at depth,in which case the product is an intrusive (or plutonic) igneous rock,such as granite or gabbro.

## Weathering of Rocks and Minerals
Factors Affecting Weathering of Rocks and Minerals: (i) Climate: The physical or mechanical process of weathering dominates over the chemical process under conditions of low rain fall of when the sizes of the minerals particles are decreased without much change in their chemical composition.What Are the Similarities and Differences Between Rocks.Minerals are generally lighter in weight and color than rocks and hold value for their aesthetic properties.Rocks,in contrast,are denser,darker and hardier and find use in the industrial and construction industries.Rocks and minerals are both geological substances found throughout the world.

## How Are Minerals Formed? Sciencing
Minerals can be formed from the intense heat and pressure found far beneath the Earth's crust in the mantle,where molten rock flows as liquid magma.Silicates in the magma can form minerals such as hornblende and other igneous rocks as the magma cools.This process can take millions of years.Case hardening of rocksnbsp 0183 32 On the outcropping surface of a nepheline syenite phonolite or nepheline syenite gneiss the minerals formed by nepheline alteration appear white in colour on the dark coloured weathered background After the nepheline alteration products are leached small holes are formed on the rock
