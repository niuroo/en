## Ball Mill Machine For Sale
Among these ball mills,the most commonly used ball mills are lattice type ball mill and overflow type ball mill (named from the different discharging structure).While the rod mill does not use a grid plate for discharging,there are only two kinds: overflow type and open type.XRD Mill McCroneThe mill is used for applications in geology,chemistry,mineralogy and materials science,quality control as well as R&amp;D.Because of its unique grinding motion,the XRD Mill McCrone is particularly effective for this analytical method: The 48 cylindrical grinding elements grind the samples gently via friction.
