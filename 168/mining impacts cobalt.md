## How does mining cobalt affect wildlife and the environment.
The first thing that can arise in one's mind is that it uses a large (I mean,like,very large) part of the land.As soon as the ecologists confirm about the presence of the ores of a element(say metal) the site is picked for mining.The local peo.Sustainability of artisanal mining of cobalt in DR CongoThe adverse environmental and human impacts of small scale and artisanal mining have been studied almost exclusively for gold mining,usually with a focus on the use of mercury,24 but also in relation to lead.25 Our study is unique in that it concerns cobalt,a critical base metal that is essential for modern technology,most notably.

## Life cycle assessment of cobalt extraction process.
Table 1 highlights some of the significant pieces of research conducted for different metals in the metal mining industries through life cycle assessment,their impacts on human health and global warming.The key aspects of their methodologies and analysis results are presented in Table 1 for aluminum,copper,gold,iron,ilmenite rutile,nickel,and uranium.Is the lithium ion battery having a positive impact on …Currently,cobalt costs around 30% more per kg than lithium and twice as much as nickel.So,for that reason,coupled with the supply risk,the drive is on among automakers led by Tesla,Toyota and BMW working with their battery suppliers to reduce the cobalt content in batteries and even replace it entirely with a nickel alternative.
