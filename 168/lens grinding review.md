## Lens Manufacturing optical lenses Britannica
Lens Lens Manufacturing optical lenses: In the manufacture of lenses,slabs of glass are cut with a glass saw or slitting disk; a piece of the desired type and shape is chipped to a rough,round blank,or the pieces may be heated to softness,rolled to a round shape,and pressed in a mold to the desired size and to approximately the desired curvature of the surfaces.High definition eyeglass lenses offer sharper visionWith free form lenses (also called digital high definition lenses),the fabrication of the lenses from wearer's eyeglass prescription is optimized with computer controlled surfacing equipment that is much more precise than conventional tools.In fact,free form technology can surface lenses in power increments of 0.01 diopter (D),compared with 0.125 to 0.25 D increments of conventional.

Essentially,the lens reaction time is a measurement of how quickly a welding helmet’s lens responds to the sudden burst of light created by a welding arc.The time is measured in thousandths of a second,with entry level models typically reacting in 1 3,600ths of a second,and professional models reacting in as fast as 1 32,000th of a second.An Introduction to the Optics Manufacturing ProcessBefore the lens undergoes further grinding,the lens must be blocked,or mounted,to begin the process.Blocking involves mounting lenses onto a convex or concave surface (inverse of the tool being used) with pitch or wax.A lens can be blocked individually (Figure 3a),but more often,many lenses with the same radii are mounted on one surface
