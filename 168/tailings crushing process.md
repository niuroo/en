## Tailings.info What Are Tailings? Their nature and production
2020430&ensp&#0183&enspConcentration is the process of extracting the economic product from the crushed and ground ore,the waste from this process is the tailings.Froth flotation (figure 2) is the most widely used concentration method and is normally the first step in the mineral processing sequence where chemical reagents are introduced (Vick 1990).Coal preparation plant WikipediaCrushing reduces the overall topsize of the ROM coal so that it can be more easily handled and processed within the CPP.Crushing requirements are an important part of CPP design and there are a number of different types.Screening.Screens in screening plant are used to group process particles into ranges by size.Dewatering screens are used to remove surface water from the product.
