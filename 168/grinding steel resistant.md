## Abrasion Resistant Steel Metal Supermarkets
What Is Abrasion Resistant Steel.Abrasion occurs when materials are rubbed across one another over a period of time.Some abrasion is intentional,such as sanding,grinding,and blasting.However,unintentional abrasion can lead to component failure so it is important to use the proper materials to ensure that surface wear does not lead to unanticipated breakdown of structures or parts.How to Reduce Steel Consumption in Grinding MillsIn primary grinding mills where rubber liners wear fairly rapidly,it would be feasible to use a highly abrasion resistant alloy iron or steel for the bars forming the wave crests and pressure mold these into less abrasion resistant matrix to form the vallyes in the composite assembly (See Figure 2A).
