Designing Concrete Mixtures There are three phases in the development of a concrete mixture: specifying,designing,and proportioning ACI Mix Design The most common method used in North America is that established by ACI Recommended Practice 211.1 Any mix design procedure will provide a first approximationIS 10262 2009 CONCRETE MIX DESIGNThe following points should be remembered before proportioning a concrete mix a per IS 10262 2009.This method of concrete mix proportioning is applicable only for ordinary and standard concrete grades.The air content in concrete is considered as nil.
