## Coal Mill
Coal ball mill is a machine that crushes and grinds the coal briquette into pulverized coal It is important auxiliary equipment of pulverized coal furnace During the coal grinding process,the coal is crushed and its superficial area increases continually To add new superficial area,the bond between solid molecules must be overcome,so the energy is consumed The coal is …Coal mill optimisation in coal fired power.This is all controlled by the coal mill or pulveriser,and its associated feeder equipment.Operation of the coal mill can affect the ramp rate of the power station and its ability to handle rapid changes in output.For coal fired power plants,the response time of the coal mills i
