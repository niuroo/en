## Bongaigaon Thermal Power Station
Kokrajhar Thermal Power Station is a coal based power plant situated in Salakati in the district of Kokrajhar in Assam.It consists of three coal fired units of 60 MW each.These units came into operation during the year 1981 to 1986 in two stages.In the first stage,two units (Unit I &amp; II) were commissioned in 1981 and 1982 respectively.Thermal power stationA thermal power station is a power station in which heat energy is converted to electric power.In most places the turbine is steam driven.Water is heated,turns into steam and spins a steam turbine which drives an electrical generator.After it passes through the turbine the steam is condensed in a condenser and recycled to where it was heated.This is known as a Rankine cycle.

## Coal mill optimisation in coal fired power stations aids.
Many of the existing pulverised coal fired (PCF) power stations are operated at a fixed steady load (i.e.baseload operation).There is however a growing requirement for load following or flexible operation,which requires flexibility in most of the components of the power station.Flexibility and.
