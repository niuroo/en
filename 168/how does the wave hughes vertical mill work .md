## Just Add Water
How Wave Pools Work.by Tom Harris.Just Add Water.Prev NEXT.In the last section,we looked at an extremely simple wave pool.In this design,short bursts of pressurized air apply force to a relatively stable pool of water.This creates little waves,which extend outward along the surface of the water.Does vegetation prevent wave erosion of salt marsh edges?&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Our empirical findings show that salt marsh vegetation does not reduce lateral erosion on wetland edges.Thus,we recommend that efforts toward salt marsh restoration,a multibillion dollar endeavor,should place the highest priority on obtaining the correct soil rather than on planting vegetation,in areas that are subject to high wave energy.

## Acoustic logging tools
The dipole transmitter exerts a differential pressure on one side of the transmitter element that creates a flexural wave in the borehole,much like the wave produced when a vertical rope is shaken from side to side.The flexural wave is dispersive,but at low frequencies this wave travels down the borehole at the formation shear velocity.How Do Underwater Turbines Work?&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;How Do Underwater Turbines Work? Underwater turbines work in much the same way as their above ground cousins.Three bladed rotors are placed on a vertical stack and are move by the motion of the water.The rotor turns a magnetic coil generator in the shaft housing which creates an electrical current.

## PEH:Acoustic Logging
The principles of borehole acoustic logging (and surface seismic methods) are based on the theory of wave propagation in an elastic medium,as detailed in several sources.The oscillating motion generated by a sound source (transducer) in an elastic medium (rock formation) is called an elastic wave or acoustic wave (also called head or body waves).
