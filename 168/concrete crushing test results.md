## Concrete slump test Wikipedia
The test is carried out using a metal mould in the shape of a conical frustum known as a slump cone or Abrams cone,that is open at both ends and has attached handlThe tool typically has an internal diameter of 100 millimetres (39 in) at the top and of 200 millimetres (79 in) at the bottom with a height of 305 millimetres (120 in)The cone is placed on a hard non absorbent surfaceCompressive Strength of Concrete Cube Test,Procedure.Compressive strength of concrete cube test provides an idea about all the characteristics of concrete.Cube test results judges proper concreting at site.

## Standards for 7 day and 28 day strength test results
A.According to section 19.2.1.3 of ACI 318 19 the specified compressive strength shall be based on the 28 day test results unless otherwise specified in the construction documents.3 or 7 day test results are used to monitor early strength gain,especially when high early strength concrete is used.However,3 and 7 day test results are not.Compressive Strength of Concrete Cube Test,Procedure. · Concrete being the major consumable material after water makes it quite inquisitive in its nature.The strength of concrete is majorly derived from aggregates,where as cement and sand contribute binding and workability along with flowability to concrete.This is an in depth article on Compressive Strength of Concrete.

By this single test one judge that whether Concreting has been done properly or not Concrete compressive strength for general construction varies from 15 MPa (2200 psi) to 30 MPa (4400 psi) and higher in commercial and industrial structur Compressive strength of concrete depends on many factors such as water cement ratio,cement strength.Flow table testnbsp 0183 32 The flow table test or flow test is a method to determine consistency of fresh concrete Flow table test is also used to identify transportable moisture limit of solid bulk cargoes 1 It is used primarily for assessing concrete that is too fluid workable to be measured using the slump test because the concrete will not retain its shape when the cone is removed
