## What is the specific gravity of sand?
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Sand particles composed of quartz have a specific gravity ranging from 2.65 to 2.67.Inorganic clay's generally range from 2.70 to 2.80.Soils with large amounts of organic matter or porous particlesStone crusher dust as a fine aggregate in Concrete for.resistance of crusher dust against alkali resistance is less than the normal sand.Density: Density of the normal concrete was found to be less than the density of the concrete containing crusher dust but specific gravity of the sand used for the preparation of concrete was found to be higher than the specific gravity of crusher dust.
