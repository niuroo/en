The openings made in the process of extracting ore are called stopes or rooms There are two steps involved in stopingThe first is development—that is,preparing the ore blocks for mining—and the second is production,or stoping,itself Ore development is generally much more expensive on a per ton basis than stoping,so that every effort is made to maximize the amount of stoping for a.Venture Vanadium Inc Provides Overview of Mineralnbsp 0183 32 PITTSBURGH PA ACCESSWIRE February 19 2020 Venture Vanadium Inc quot Venture Vanadium quot or quot the Company quot OTC VENV a progressive American battery metals exploration and development company is pleased to provide an overview of the Company s Desgrobois Vanadium Project including work completed on the property in 2019 and details of the planned 3 phase
