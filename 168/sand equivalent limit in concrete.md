## Alternative materials for concrete— Mersey silt as fine,
Small additions of clay actually increased the strength,an observation confirmed by Dreux[9] who studied the effect of sand cleanliness,measured by the sand equivalent test,on concrete properti As the sand equivalent fell with increasing clay content the strength passed through a maximum before decliningSiteManager Forms Texas Department of TransportationBelow are links to Excel forms for use with SiteManager,a software program that automates and streamlines the management of highway construction contracts
