## Taking the Mystery Out of Mix Design Concrete
nbsp 0183 32 In fresh concrete the cementitious paste lubricates the aggregate particles making it easier for them to slip past each other For example compare the steepness of the sides of a stockpile of crushed stone with the much shallower angle of repose observed with even low slump concreteP amp Q University Lesson 2nbsp 0183 32 Coarse aggregate from sand and gravel deposits should also be tested for the physical properties listed above plus bulk density and gradation Concrete sand requires a specific gradation measured on percentages retained on various screen sizes
