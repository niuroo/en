## Speed of sound
The speed of sound is the distance travelled per unit time by a sound wave as it propagates through an elastic medium.At 20 &#176;C (68 &#176;F),the speed of sound in air is about 343 metres per second (1,235 km h; 1,125 ft s; 767 mph; 667 kn),or a kilometre in 2.9 s or a mile in 4.7 s.It depends strongly on temperature,but also varies by several metres per second,depend1 8&quot; end mill speeds in MDF1 8&quot; end mill speeds in MDF 24V Spindle.X Carve.Slower speed,but deeper cut depth.Edges were never close to perfect though,even at the slower cuts.I just cut two doors for my cart from 3 4&quot; MDF with the ball end mill,which went pretty quick now that I have the speed and depth dialed in.I let it trim 0.120&quot; off of one end to ensure.
