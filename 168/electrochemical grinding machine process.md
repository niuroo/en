## Electrochemical Grinding SpringerLink
Electrochemical grinding (ECG) is a hybrid process combining grinding and ECM,which uses a grinding wheel as electrode to remove electrically conductive material.Direct current (DC) flows through an electrolyte between the negatively charged grinding wheel and the positively charged workpiece.Burr Free Electrochemical GrindingThe Burr Free Electrochemical Grinding process is a hybrid method of metal removal combining Abrasive Grinding and Electrochemical Machining (or ECM).ECM is a non traditional metal removal method developed many years ago based on Michael Faraday’s laws of electrolysis.
