## Iron Ore Pelletizing Process: An Overview
Plant capacities were between 10,000 and 60,000 tons year [1].The world installed pelletizing capacity is currently estimated to be 480.7 million tons year [2].As shown in Figure 1,China presents the largest production capacity,followed by the United States and Brazil.The iron ore pelletizing process consists of three main steps: 1.Direct Reduced Iron and its Production Processes IspatGuru · The reductant can be a gas or a solid.Major DRI production processes are either natural gas based or coal based.Feed material for the DR process is either sized iron ore of size ranging from 10 mm to 30 mm or iron ore pellets of size ranging from 8 mm to 20 mm produced in an iron ore pellet plant.The gas based process uses a shaft furnace.

## FACT SHEET Energy use in the steel industry
2019 4 22&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;ENERGY USE IN THE STEEL INDUSTRY Most steel products remain in use for decades or even centuries before their function is no longer needed and they can then be reused,remanufactured or recycled.Therefore,there is not enough recycled steel to meet growing demand.Demand is met through a combined use of the BF BOF and EAF production routes.(PDF) Iron Ore Pelletizing Process: An OverviewPlant capacities were between 10,000 and 60,000 tons .Iron Ore Pelletizing Process: An Overview.One of them has been used in commercial production of iron ore pellets in China.View.
