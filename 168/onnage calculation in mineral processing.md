## Tailings Processing Project 1911 Gold
Tailings Processing Project Under the ownership of Klondex Mines Ltd.the operations identified the potential in the tailings stored in the impoundment facility at site.Drilling undertaken in 2014 showed an average grade of.043 oz t or 1.47g t,supporting the development of a system to re process the tailings.Sampling in Mineral ProcessingWhat is sampling in mineral processing? Sampling is the procedure by which some members of a population are selected as representative of the entire population for studies and conclusions.In mineral processing,it refers to selecting representitive members of the ore in various space and or time for assays,mineralogical,minerallurgical studies,metallurgical testing,pilot plant testing.
