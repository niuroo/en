## Rutile
Rutile is a common accessory mineral in high temperature and high pressure metamorphic rocks and in igneous rocks.Thermodynamically,rutile is the most stable polymorph of TiO 2 at all temperatures,exhibiting lower total free energy than metastable phases of anatase or brookite.Consequently,the transformation of the metastable TiO 2 polymorphs to rutFormation and Transformation of TiO2 (Anatase) Solid.At higher temperatures,anatase solid solutions transform into TiO 2 (rutile) with the formation of Œ±‚ÄêAl 2 O 3.Powder characterization is studied.Pure anatase crystallizes at 220&#176; to 360&#176;C,and the anatase‚Äêto‚Äêrutile phase transformation occurs at 770&#176; to 850&#176;C.

## Anatase
Anatase is metastable at all temperatures and pressures,with rutile being the equilibrium polymorph.Nevertheless,anatase is often the first titanium dioxide phase to form in many processes,due to its lower surface energy,with a transformation to rutile taking place at elevated temperatures.Although the degree of symmetry is the same for.Suppression of Anatase to Rutile Phase Transformation of.Anatase to rutile transformation usually result in significant grain growth [Iida and Ozaki,1961; Zhang and Reller,2002],while thermal gradient enhances surface nucleation of rutile phase.However,anatsae to rutile phase transformation can be impeded (or enhanced)

## Why is anatase a better photocatalyst than rutile?
Anatase exhibits an indirect band gap that is smaller than its direct band gap.For rutile,on the other hand,its fundamental band gap is either direct or its indirect band gap is very similar to.Size effect on thermal stability of nanocrystalline.convert nanocrystalline anatase into rutile rapidly in the temperature range where the phase transformation does not occur in coarse anatase TiO 2.Overall,both grain growth and phase transformation in smaller anatase NPs happen at lower temperatures and faster than in bigger ones.The coupled sintering phase transformation mechanism can be.
