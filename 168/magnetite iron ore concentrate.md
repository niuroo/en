Our range of Iron Ore includes Hematite Iron Ore and Magnetite Iron Ore,We extract iron ore from beneath the surface rock,crush it and concentrate it We can then either transform it into iron pellets suitable for use in blast furnaces,or transport it directly to our deep water port facility in Persian Gulf to be shipped to customers.Iron ore chemeuropeThe key economic parameters for magnetite ore being economic are the crystallinity of the magnetite,the grade of the iron within the BIF host rock,and the contaminant elements which exist within the magnetite concentrate
