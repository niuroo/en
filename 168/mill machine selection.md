I used the following process to decide which machine was right for me.1 What is your goal for the machine? That may seem like a strange question.For me I wanted something that I could use to build other machines.A CNC mill seemed like the best fit.

## How to Optimize Results While Machining with Miniature
nbsp 0183 32 The machining industry generally considers miniature end mills to be any end mill with a diameter under 1 8 of an inch This is also often the point where tolerances must be held to a tighter window Because the diameter of a tool is directly related to the strength ofG17 G18 G19Short answer is cnc machinists are not required to program Plane selection G codes G17 G18 G19.Because when you turn on CNC machines some G codes get active automatically (sometimes are called Default G codes).So on CNC Mills G17 X Y plane is active when you turn on the machine.Same way CNC Lathe has G18 Z X
