## How Does a Cyclone Separator Work
nbsp 0183 32 A cyclone separator uses a form of inertia called centrifugal force typically to move air that is filled with dirt and dust through a vertical cylinder with a cone shaped bottom The air moves very quickly as it enters the chamber at the top of the cylinder creating a mini2 Phase Disc Separatornbsp 0183 32 centrifugal force makes the solid slag separated from the liquid in the disc stack deposit into the solid slag collection cavity at the edge of the bowl The self discharging 2 phase disc separator can be adjusted according to the material
