## Conventional Grinding
Conventional Grinding Conventional grinding takes place in tumbling mills where the ore is introduced into a horizontal mill where the cylindrical body of the mill is turned by a motor,causing the mill charge of ore and grinding media to tumble.From: Wills' MineralGrinding Circuit an overview ScienceDirect TopicsGrinding circuits are fed at a controlled rate from the stockpile or bins holding the crusher plant product There may be a number of grinding circuits in parallel,each circuit taking a definite fraction of the feed An example is the Highland Valley Cu Mo plant with five parallel grinding lines (Chapter 12 )

## Ball mill Wikipedia
A ball mill is a type of grinder used to grind and blend materials for use in mineral dressing processes,paints,pyrotechnics,ceramics and selective laser sintering.It works on the principle of impact and attrition: size reduction is done by impact as the balls drop from near the top of the shell.A ball mill consists of a hollow&nbsp;.Grinding Circuit Final Grind Control at Agnico Eagle,Grinding Circuit an overview ScienceDirect Topics
