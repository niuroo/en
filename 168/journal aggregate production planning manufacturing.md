## Multisite aggregate production and distribution planning,
A good size of literature has been published and trend is continuing In the light of impact of multi site manufacturing in gaining commercial advantage in global competition scenario,this review is dedicated to multi site aggregate production planning (MSAPP) and multi site aggregate P D planning,Enhanced Simulated Annealing for Solving Aggregate.Simulated annealing has been an effective means that can address difficulties related to optimisation problems.is now a common discipline for research with several productive applications such as production planning.Due to the fact that aggregate production planning is one of the most considerable problems in production planning,in this paper,we present multiobjective linear programming.
