## Planetary Ball Mill PM 100
Planetary Ball Mills are used wherever the highest degree of fineness is required.In addition to well proven mixing and size reduction processes,these mills also meet all technical requirements for colloidal grinding and provide the energy input necessary for mechanical alloying.The extremely high centrifugal forces of a planetary ball mill result in very high pulverization energy and.electric control circuits for ball mill for iron oreA mill is a device that breaks solid materials into smaller pieces by grinding,crushing,or cutting.Today they are usually powered by electricity.''rod mill'' is also used as a synonym for a slitting mill,which makes rods of iron or other metal.Rod mills are less common than ball mills for grinding minerals.Authority control.

## The operating principle of the ball mill
The operating principle of the ball mill consists of following steps.In a continuously operating ball mill,feed material fed through the central hole one of the caps into the drum and moves therealong,being exposed by grinding media.The material grinding occurs during impact falling grindinEmaxThe greatest challenge when developing a high energy ball mill is keeping the temperature under control as the enormous size reduction energy leads to considerable heat built up inside the grinding jar.RETSCH solved this problem with an innovative integrated water cooling system.
