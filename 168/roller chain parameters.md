## Roller chain Wikipedia
Roller chain or bush roller chain is the type of chain drive most commonly used for transmission of mechanical power on many kinds of domestic,industrial and agricultural machinery,including conveyors,wire and tube drawing machines,printing presses,cars,motorcycles,and bicycles.It consists of a series of short cylindrical rollers held together by side links.ISO Roller Chain Sprockets Selection Guide Engineering360The sprocket's teeth mesh within a roller chain,thereby transferring rotational energy between parallel axes over distances.Sprockets have several points of high friction contact with a roller chain,which is important to efficient rotation,but also wears the sprocket and roller chain quickly.
