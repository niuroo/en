## Ball Mills Functionality
A ball mill,a type of grinder,is a cylindrical device used in grinding (or mixing) materials like ores,chemicals,ceramic raw materials and paints.Ball mills rotate around a horizontal axis,partially filled with the material to be ground plus the grinding medium.Ball milling as a mechanochemical technology for â€¦&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;By comparison,planetary ball mills are compact in size and feasible for laboratories.During the ball milling process,to avoid physical or chemical destruction (e.g.oxidation),milling chambers can be filled with gases such as NH 3,Ar,and hydrocarbon gases ().

## Factors Affecting Ball Mill Grinding Efficiency
The following are factors that have been investigated and applied in conventional ball milling in order to maximize grinding efficiency: a) Mill Geometry and Speed Bond (1954) observed grinding efficiency to be a function of ball mill diameter,and established empirical relationships for recommended media size and mill speed that take this factor into account.Ball Mills for Mineral Plants,Ball Mills Exporters and.Ball Mill plants are set up to perform the coarse grinding function.Our continuous Ball Mill works unstoppably for long periods.We make high end,stainless steel ball mills.These mills are perfectly designed for grinding ores and minerals.They accept the feed size of 6mm and Moh's hardness upto 5 to d97 &lt; 6um.
