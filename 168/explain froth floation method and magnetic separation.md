## flotation process in mineral processing
Froth flotation is a process for selectively separating hydrophobic materials from hydrophilic This is used in mineral processing recycling and waste water treatment industries Historically this was first used in the mining industry where it was one of the great enabling technologies of the 20th centuryContact angles history of over 200 years of open questionsnbsp 0183 32 The flotation separation method was invented in the second half of the nineteenth century and it spread worldwide as one of the most advanced methods in recovery and purification of mined ores 23 Coghill and Anderson 24 made probably the first attempt to describe flotation of minerals materials and pointed to the importance of contact angles in flotation systems
