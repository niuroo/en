## Titanium Dioxide
Titanium Dioxide (TiO 2) is the most important and widely used white pigment in the coatings industry.Chemours,TiO 2 technology efficiently scatters visible light,thereby imparting whiteness,brightness and opacity.Chemours,TiO 2 technology is used to opacify paint films by diffusely reflecting light.White pigment scatters or bends light strongly and causes this reflection.Titanium Dioxide Crusher Machinery IlmeniteTitanium dioxide Wikipedia Titanium dioxide,also known as titanium(IV) oxide or titania,is the naturally occurring oxide of titanium,chemical formula TiO 2When used as a pigment,it is called titanium white,Pigment White 6 (PW6),or CI 77891Generally,it is sourced from ilmenite,rutile and anataseIt has a wide range of applications.
