## Potash Flotation Process
Potash occurs in soft deposits generally associated with sodium chloride and varying amounts of clay slime,which because of its colloidal character,complicates the beneficiation process.Potash ores generally contain 20 to 40 percent KCL with the balance being NaCl and a small amount of clay slime,the latter usually in the order of 1 to 1&#189;%.
