## Flow properties of coal water slurries (Journal Article.
Abstract.Properties of coal water slurries were studied in two separate phases: a rheological phase and a pipeline phase.The primary purpose was to investigate the rheology of fine coal slurries,and the secondary purpose was to determine whether the energy requirements of a coal water slurry pipeline could be predicted from the rheology data.Adsorption of ammonia nitrogen on lignite and its.Using lignite as an adsorbent and subsequently as a material for coal water slurry (CWS) preparation represents an alternative method for coal chemical wastewater treatment.Associated with adsorption reaction model.The air dried lignite samples were ground using a ball mill for 30 min and 180 min to obtain coarse and fine samples.
