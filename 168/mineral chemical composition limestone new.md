## University of Minnesota’s Mineral Pages: Calcite
Aragonite is a polymorph of calcite,a mineral that has the same chemical composition as calcite,but has a slightly different crystal structure.For most purposes aragonite and calcite can be considered to be the same mineral.As a consequence,calcite is not only the main mineral of limestone rocks and marble (metamorphosed limestone.Limestone Chemical Components SciencingMinor chemical components of limestone include clay,feldspar,pyrite and quartz.Feldspar crystallizes from magma,thus is more commonly found in volcanic rocks.Feldspar is widely used in the ceramic,adhesive and glass industries.
