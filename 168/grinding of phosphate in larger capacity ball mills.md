## What is the difference between angular contact bearing
nbsp 0183 32 There are contact angles between the races and the ball The standard contact angles are 15 25 and 40 degrees The larger the contact angle is the greater the axial load capacity is The smaller the contact angle is the better the high speed rotation is SingleTailoring ball mill feed size distribution for the productionnbsp 0183 32 These factors among others lead to random interaction of particles in tumbling mills making the breakage mechanisms in such mills difficult to understand However using mathematical models Austin et al 1984 demonstrated that material breakage in a ball mill can be defined by a size mass balance commonly known as the population balance model PBM Eq
