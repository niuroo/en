## 5.The role of design and equipment selection
Mill layout and equipment selection go hand in hand,in that the needs of the equipment with respect to the processes,flow direction,ease of operation and maintenance,etc.must be blended into the overall plan,with the ultimate objective of maximizing the productivity of each machine and minimizing handling.OSHA Technical Manual (OTM) Section III: Chapter 3.The four standards in 29 CFR 1910.94 deal with local exhaust systems,and OSHA's construction standards (29 CFR 1926) contain ventilation standards for welding.OSHA's compliance policy regarding violation of ventilation standards is set forth in the Field Inspection Reference Manual.If air flow is satisfactory in a hood but contaminant.
