## Chapter 18.Feed Milling Processes
Heat imparted to the material,due to the work of grinding,is related to the time it is held within the chamber and the air flow characteristics.Impact grinding is most efficient with dry,low fat ingredients,although many other materials may be reduced in size by proper screen selection and regulated intake.How to Size a Ball Mill Design Calculator &amp; Formula2) Ball milling a ball mill with a diameter of 2.44 meters,inside new liners,grinding wet in open circuit.When the grinding conditions differ from these specified conditions,efficiency factors (Ro
