## Ball mill Wikipedia
A ball mill is a type of grinder used to grind or blend materials for use in mineral dressing processes,paints,pyrotechnics,ceramics,and selective laser sinteringIt works on the principle of impact and attrition: size reduction is done by impact as the balls drop from near the top of the shell A ball mill consists of a hollow cylindrical shell rotating aboutFactors Affecting Ball Mill Grinding Efficiency25 10 2017&#0183;&#32;The following are factors that have been investigated and applied in conventional ball milling in order to maximize grinding efficiency: a) Mill Geometry and Speed Bond (1954) observed grinding efficiency to be a function of ball mill diameter,and established empirical relationships for recommended media size and mill speed that take this factor into account

## Minerals Free Full Text Effects of Ball Size on the,
In this study,we investigate the effect of the ball size in a high energy ball mill on the comminution rate and particle size reduction High energy ball milling at 2000 rpm produces ultrafine talc particles with a surface area of 4191 m2 g and an estimated spherical diameter of 51 nm Increasing the ball size from 01 mm to 2 mm increases.A Note on Particle Size Analyses of Kaolins and Claysnbsp 0183 32 The particle size distribution of powders after standard milling and cryogenic milling respectively was measured via laser diffraction Analysette 22 NanoTec Fritsch using the Fraunhofer
