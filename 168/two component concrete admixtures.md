## Mineral Admixture
Two basic types of admixtures are available: chemical and mineral.All admixtures to be used in major concrete construction should meet specifications: tests should be made to evaluate how the admixture will affect the properties of the concrete to be made.Concrete AdmixturesConcrete admixtures are additions to the concrete mix to achieve certain results and goals.Find out what admixtures are and why they are used.Water Reducing Admixtures (Also called plasticizer and super plasticizer) Plasticizers reduce the amount of water needed in the concrete mix.
