The ball load behaviour in a pilot mill is studied under conditions of increasing particle filling,for coarse silica feed (0.8 1.8 mm) and fine silica feed (0.075 0.3 mm),at the mill speeds.Effect of lifters and mill speed on particle behaviour.DEM is a highly convenient approach to determine the particle behaviour,torque,and power draw of ball mills in different conditions.Consequently,DEM is used in the present study as a tool to examine the effect of lifters and mill speed on the particle behaviour,torque,and power draw of a ball mill.
