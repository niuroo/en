## Final Taconite Iron Ore Processing Risk and Technology,
Sep 07,2021&#0183;&#32;June 17,2020 The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has evaluated the risks remaining after fully implementing the 2003 National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) for Taconite Iron Ore Processing and determined that risks from this source category are acceptable EPA has determined the standards continue to provide an ample margin of safety to,Green MiningIn situ mining (see mining solution page) can be more environmentally friendly than underground mining and is cheaper than many mining methods (Ulmer Scholle,2008) However,in situ mining cannot be implemented in all cases as the ore needs to be beneath the water table (the level at which the ground is saturated with water) and it needs to be.
