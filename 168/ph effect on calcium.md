## Effect of Bicarbonate,Calcium,and pH on the Reactivity.
Natural or anthropogenic processes can increase the concentration of uranium (U) and arsenic (As) above the maximum contaminant levels in water sources.Bicarbonate and calcium (Ca) can have major impacts on U speciation and can affect the reactivity between U and As.We therefore investigated the reactivity of aqueous U and As mixtures with bicarbonate and Ca for acidic and neutral pH.Effects of pH and calcium on soil organic matter …5) pH,similar to in situ patterns of leaching among landscape ages,but there was no consistent effect of pH on dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in leachates across landscape ages.Increasing Ca concentration inhibited cumulative DOC in leachates at circumneutral pH as expected,but had no effect on DOC or DON in leachates at acidic pH.

## Soil pH Wikipedia
The soil pH usually increases when the total alkalinity increases,but the balance of the added cations also has a marked effect on the soil pH.For example,increasing the amount of sodium in an alkaline soil tends to induce dissolution of calcium carbonate,which increases the pH.The Alkaline Diet: An Evidence Based Review · The alkaline diet is also known as the acid alkaline diet or alkaline ash diet.Its premise is that your diet can alter the pH value — the measurement of acidity or alkalinity — of your body.
