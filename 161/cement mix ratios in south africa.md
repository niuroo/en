## Concrete Calculator
Our mix on site concrete calculation is based on batching by volume (Large construction sites employ batching by weight which is more exact).You can also estimate the quantity of sand and gravel required by weight; Simply multiply the volumetric quantity of sand and gravel with 1400 kg m 3 (bulk density of sand) and 1600 kg m 3 (bulk density of stone) respectively,when calculating in metric.Concrete Mixes by Weight and VolumeWe have had numerous requests for concrete mix ratios by weight,by volume,and by mass.Here is a table that was released by the Cement and Concrete Institute for trial concrete mixes from 10MPa to 40MPa.These are trial mixes and should be used to test your concrete before it is used in any construction work.
