## Sand casting
Sand casting,also known as sand molded casting,is a metal casting process characterized by using sand as the mold material.The term &quot;sand casting&quot; can also refer to an object produced via the sand casting process.Sand castings are produced in specialized factories called foundries.Core (manufacturing)When casting a reentrant angle,instead of using a core a cheek can be used.This is a third segment in the flask,in addition to the cope and drag.This allows the entire mold to be made from green sand and from removable patterns.The disadvantage of this is more.
