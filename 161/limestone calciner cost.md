## Lime kiln
A lime kiln is a kiln used for the calcination of limestone (calcium carbonate) to produce the form of lime called quicklime (calcium oxide).The chemical equation for this reaction is CaCO 3 + heat → CaO + CO 2 This reaction takes place at 900 C (1,650 F) (at.NOx Emissions from New Cement Kilns EPAspecifically on staged combustion in the calciner (SCC),selective noncatalytic reduction.(SNCR),and selective catalytic reduction (SCR) as processes for the control of NOx.Practices and controls that are incorporated in normal operating processes for cement kilns will also be discussed.Previous EPA documents on NOx&nbsp;.

## The Carbonate Looping process SCARLET
The Calcium Carbonate Looping (CCL) process addressed in the SCARLET project is a promising post combustion CO2 capture technology using limestone as solid sorbent.Because of the fact that the CO2 release in the calciner is an endothermic reaction,it is necessary to provide heat by combusting fuel with oxygen.Lime and Limestone Wiley Online Library2.8 million Btu per ton (0.64 million kg Cal metric ton) of CaO.In practice,heat input may vary from 4 to 10 million Btu ton (0.9 to 2.3 million kg cal metric ton) of lime.Calcination of limestone particles proceeds by a receding surface mechanism.To attain rea sonable rates of heat transfer into the center of the rock or pebble .
