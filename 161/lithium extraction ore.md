## Lithium Mining and Environmental Impact
Lithium mining carries high environmental costs.Mining companies prospecting lithium in northern Tibet,salt plains of South America,and Chile as well as lithium at Bolivia's Salar De Uyuni require extensive extraction operations and water in a dry land.Extraction of lithium from primary and secondary sources …Lithium concentrate obtained mainly by the flotation of pegmatites (ore),is pulverized and leached in hot acid,and lithium is precipitated as lithium carbonate (Tahil,2010).The processing of pegmatites is expensive as compared to that of the brines due to the heating and dissolution steps involved,but the higher metal concentration in pegmatites partly compensates for the cost.
