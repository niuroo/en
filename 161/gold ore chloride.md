## Extraction of Gold
When the gold has solidified,the molten silver chloride collected on the surface is run off,carrying with it a small proportion of gold.When silver is the chief impurity in the gold,as in that found in Australia,the process is specially applicable.Processing,smelting and refining gold World Gold CouncilWhen gold dissolution is complete,the gold bearing solution is separated from the solids.With ores of higher gold content (greater than 20 grams of gold per tonne of ore),cyanidation is accomplished by vat leaching,which involves holding a slurry of ore and solvent in large tanks equipped with agitators.
