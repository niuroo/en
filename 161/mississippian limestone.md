## Scouring the Mississippian of Alabama Time Scavengers
Cam here I spend my time working on lectures,reading books,or annotating scientific papers.But,every once in a while,I get to collect fossils and do field work.I haven't been out in the field since June of 2017.On January 13th and 14th of this year,I spent theMississippian Subperiod geochronology BritannicaMississippian Subperiod,first major subdivision of the Carboniferous Period,lasting from 358.9 to 323.2 million years ago.The Mississippian is characterized by shallow water limestone deposits occupying the interiors of continents,especially in the Northern

## Carboniferous Period
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Deposits of crinoidal limestone approaching 150 metres (500 feet) are not uncommon in intervals of Mississippian age,particularly in North America,and they are exploited as quarry stone.In addition to the crinoidal limestones,oolitic limestones and lime mudstones also formed in shallow water marine environments of the Mississippian.IN THE “MISSISSIPPIAN LIMESTONE” OFThe “Mississippian Limestone” of the Mid Continent United States is a complex and highly heterogeneous hydrocarbon play.Its heterogeneity is largely due to the mixed siliciclastic and carbonate nature of the Mid Continent Mississippian system which yields.

Limestone,the most abundant Mississippian rock type in Illinois,formed differently.Limestone is primarily calcium carbonate (calcite,or CaCO 3 ) and can form in several different ways.One of the most common ways begins with sea animals (such as crinoids,brachiopods,bryozoans,and mollusks) that secrete calcium carbonate to form their protective shells.KGS Stratigraphic Succession MississippianMISSISSIPPIAN SYSTEM By Edwin D.Goebel Mississippian rocks are present in the subsurface throughout the State except on the crests of the Central Kansas uplift,the Cambridge arch,the northern and northwestern parts of the Nemaha anticline,and some isolated areas,where they have been removed by early Mississippian,late Mississippian,and early Pennsylvanian erosion (Fig.6).
