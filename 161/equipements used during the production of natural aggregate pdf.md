## Construction aggregate
Construction aggregate,or simply aggregate,is a broad category of coarse to medium grained particulate material used in construction,including sand,gravel,crushed stone,slag,recycled concrete and geosynthetic aggregates.Aggregates are the most mined materials in the world.Aggregates are a component of composite materials such as.3 Aggregate Properties4 AGGREGATE VOIDS There are aggregate particle voids,and there are voids between aggregate particles.As solid as aggregate may be to the naked eye,most aggregate particles have voids,which are natural pores that are filled with air or water.These voids
