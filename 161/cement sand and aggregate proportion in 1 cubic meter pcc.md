## Specifications for Plain Cement Concrete (PCC) Building …
Plain Cement Concrete (PCC) is a construction material generally used as a binding materials and is composed of cement,(commonly Portland Cement) and other cementitious materials such as fly ash and slag cement,aggregate (generally a coarse aggregate made of gravels or crushed rocks such as limestone or granite,plus a fine aggregate such as sand),water,and chemical admixtures.CONCRETE MIXING RATIOSConcrete mixing ratios for cement,sand,aggregate,and water are generally mixed as 1 part cement,3 parts sand,and 3 parts aggregate or stone with just enough water to make it workable.
