## Coal fired power station
A coal fired power station is a type of fossil fuel power station.The coal is usually pulverized and then burned in a furnace with a boiler.The furnace heat converts boiler water to steam,which is then used to spin turbines which turn generators.Thus chemical energy stored in coal is converted successively into thermal energy,mechanical energy and,finally,electrical energy.standard operating procedure of coal power plantstandard operating procedure of coal power plant.Products List.McMurdo Power Plant Standard Operating Procedure NSF.McMurdo Power Plant.Standard Operating Procedure.OP M 900.Revis
