## Proper Selection of Grinding Wheels
The grinding wheel is an abrasive cutting tool responsible for the removal of excess unnecessary parts of the workpiece and for optimizing surface finishing.There are a lot of factors to consider in selecting which wheels are to be used in a particular operation:Factors affecting proper coolant application when …&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Grinding is a thermally dominated process,meaning a high percentage of process heat initially enters the part before coolant quenches it.Unless the coolant is applied at the correct flow rate and pressure,and the proper input conditions are selected,this process can lead to undesirable rehardening burn,thermal softening and tensile residual stresses.
