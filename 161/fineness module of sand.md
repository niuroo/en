Fineness Modulus of Sand Why to Determine Fineness Modulus? Fineness modulus is generally used to get an idea of how coarse or fine the aggregate is More fineness modulus value indicates that the aggregate is coarser and small value of fineness modulus indicates that the aggregate is finerThe Importance of Fineness Modulus Concrete,The Importance of Fineness Modulus,For the high cement contents used in the production of high strength concrete,coarse sand with an FM around 30 produces concrete with the best workability and highest compressive strength More,

In Todays world,Fineness modulus is not used for getting idea about fineness on material.it is also omitted from IS Code.More ever this value wont make any sense as it can get manipulated easily and it can show sand as fine but in reality its a coarse and vice aCHAPTER 31 Chapter 3 Physical Properties of Structural Lightweight Aggregate April 2007 Expanded Shale,Clay &amp; Slate Institute (ESCSI) 2225 E.Murray Holladay Rd,Suite 102 Salt Lake City,U (801) 7070 Fax: (801) 3377 info@escsi.org www.escsi
