ABSTRACT:Technological advancements have driven up temperature and pressure serviced in the petroleum,chemical,pulp,and environmental protection.Industries,and increased the possibility of severe corrosion and wear in process pressure vessels.The industries must upgrade the corrosion and wear performance of these main important parts.Economic features as a rule will not allow.81 5 EDM Process Understanding the Wire16&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;layer.&quot; The depth of the heat affected zone and recast depends upon the power,type of power supply,and the number of skim cuts.The recast contains a layer of unexpelled molten material.When skim cuts are used,much less energy is applied to the surface.This greatly reduces and practically eliminates the recast layer.

## Abrasive Blasting
Abrasive blasting or sand blasting is a widely used material removal process.The microfabrication version,typically called powder blasting,has been demonstrated as a viable,low cost option for the fabrication of MEMS and microfluidic devices,especially for brittle materials (Figure 15).The resolution possible for powder blasting is reduced by the size of the particles,which typically.NEPTUN27&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Wire brushes Abrasive strip rollers Detail Spring steel wire High Density Fleece Rollers Spring steel brush rollers Working Width 1500 mm Material Thickness 0,8 100 mm Width 2704 mm Depth 870 mm Height 1650 mm Power 12 kW Amperage 24 A Air Supply 6 bar Air Consumption 80 Nl min Brush Rollers Technical Data Module Oxide layer removal Edge.
