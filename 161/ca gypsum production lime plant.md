## soybean yield and quality as a function of lime and gypsum.
In Brazil alone,some 4.5 million tons are produced each year (Vitti,2000).Gypsum application to top soil results in improved root growth and increased water and nutrient uptake by plants (Sumner et al.1986;.Marsh &amp; Grove,1992; Carvalho &amp; Raij,1997) as a result of the increase in subsoil Ca content and the for .(PDF) Utilization of waste gypsum in fertilizer productionMalinowski et al.(2014) made a study on the utilization of waste gypsum in fertilizer production and concluded that by product gypsum can be used for the production of the granulated fertilizers.
