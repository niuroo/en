## Research review of cement clinker chemistry ,
A great amount of wastes from industrial,municipal,agricultural sectors are used as AFR in the production process of cement clinker nowadays,for the reason of both lowering the consumption of natural resources and reducing the emissions in cement industry and waste disposal for other industrial sectorsReactions in the cement kiln clinkeringClinker: reactions in the kiln,However,reading an article or two is perhaps not the best way to get a clear picture of a complex process like cement production,The following pages have more details on clinker composition,reactions in the kiln and cement milling:.
