Oct 01,2020&#0183;&#32;This research focused the role to study the effects and ways to control the chemical composition of clinker for better cement production Cement is a substance produced by grinding a mixture of a clay and limestone and heating to a temperature of 1450&#176;C,in which the chemical transformation occurs inside the kiln to form new compound called clinkerHow to make fast setting cement QuoraAnswer (1 of 4): Fast setting cement or fast setting concrete? The former can be achieved by reducing the gypsum content,and by grinding the clinker finer Or adjusting the C3A content etc The latter can be achieved by adding triethanolamine or preferably calcium,
