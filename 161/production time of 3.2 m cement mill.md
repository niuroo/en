## Cement mill
A cement mill (or finish mill in North American usage) is the equipment used to grind the hard,nodular clinker from the cement kiln into the fine grey powder that is cement.Most cement is currently ground in ball mills and also vertical roller mills which are more effective than ball mills.Coal Bottom Ash for Portland Cement ProductionThe specific surface Blaine of the cement was 4,050 m 2 kg; fineness of the collected coal fly ash was 3,976 m 2 kg.The coal bottom ash was ground in a ball mill up to a Blaine fineness of 3,463 m 2 kg,similar to that of the Portland cement (5 8% residue on 45 μm sieve).Several coal fly and ground coal bott

## Introduction to Iron and Steel
Introduction to Iron and Steel A few definitions and general descriptions are in order Pig iron: Raw iron,the immediate product of smelting iron ore with coke and limestone in a blast furnace.Pig iron has a very high carbon content,typically 4 5%,which makes it very brittle and not very useful directly as a material.A Selection of MechanicalCement ProductionAt the same time,the cement industry is facing challenges such as cost increases in energy supply (Lund,2007),requirements to reduce CO 2 emissions,and the supply of raw materials in sufficient qualities and amounts (WBCSD,2008).In this chapter,the environmental impact of cement production will be described.

## Cement Milling
Cement milling and gypsum dehydration Because the cement gets hot due to the heat generated by grinding,gypsum can be partly dehydrated,forming hemihydrate,or plaster of Paris 2CaSO 4.H 2 O.On further heating,hemihydrate dehydrates further to a form of calcium sulfate known as soluble anhydrite (~CaSO 4 ).Effect of clinker free lime and cement fineness on the.The first type is taken from the production chain of the HolcimRas El Ma company: Eight samples of clinker and cement corresponding were taken from cement doser mill BK III which we designate by C IIIi,with i varies from 1 to 8 (Group G 1) and the other three samples were removed under cement doser mill BK IV which we denote by C IVJ
