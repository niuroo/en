## Cement
A cement is a binder,a substance used for construction that sets,hardens,and adheres to other materials to bind them together.Cement is seldom used on its own,but rather to bind sand and gravel together.Cement mixed with fine aggregate produces mortar for masonry,or with sand and gravel,produces concrete.the wet and dry processes of cement with diagramdiagram of flow chart of cement wet manufacturing process,In dry and semi dry processes for manufacturing of cement,the raw materials are crushed and fed in the correct proportions into a grinding mill The raw materials are dried and reduced in size to a fine.
