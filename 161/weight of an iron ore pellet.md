## Characterisation of the Physical and Metallurgical …
The blast furnace is still the dominant form of iron production,but over the years,direct reduction methods have increased due to a number of reasons.Overall,iron production methods have optimal requirements with respect to the feed materials especially iron ore.In this study,tests were carried out on Muko iron ore from Uganda to analyse its suitability to meet the feed requirements of.Iron Ore Pelletizing Process: An Overview IntechOpenThe iron ore production has significantly expanded in recent years,owing to increasing steel demands in developing countries.However,the content of iron in ore deposits has deteriorated and low grade iron ore has been processed.The fines resulting from the concentration process must be agglomerated for use in iron and steelmaking.This chapter shows the status of the pelletizing process.
