## Copper and Cyanide Recovery in Cyanidation Effluents
2013 12 24&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;recovery of gold from Merrill Crowe process cyanide solution,involves two different operations: 1) gold dis solution,where it is oxidized and dissolved to form Au (I) ion and cyanide complex 2,and 2) precipitation by reduction of metallic gold.In the cyanidation process,free cyanide ions in solution can only be provided at a pH of 9.0.How to Operate a Merrill Crowe Precipitation ProcessIn the Merrill Crowe Process the oxygen is mechanically removed in a preliminary conditioning step,by subjecting the solution to the action of a high vacuum.Carbon dioxide is simultaneously removed,thus minimizing the formation of calcium carbonate in the precipitate filter.
