## Mix Design Concrete Grade Of C
Concrete mix design is the process of finding the proportions of concrete mix in terms of ratios of cement,sand and coarse aggregates.For e.g.a concrete mix of proportions 1:2:4 means that cement,fine and coarse aggregate are in the ratio 1:2:4 or the mix contains one part of cement,two parts of fine aggregate and four parts of coarse aggregate.
