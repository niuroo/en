## High energy ball milling process for nanomaterial synthesis
It is a ball milling process where a powder mixture placed in the ball mill is subjected to high energy collision from the balls.This process was developed by Benjamin and his coworkers at the International Nickel Company in the late of 1960.Cement millThese have been used for many years for the less exacting raw milling process,but recently roller mills,in combination with high efficiency separators,have been used for cement grinding.The grinding action employs much greater stress on the material than in a ball mill,and is therefore more efficient.
