## Membrane Filter Press
A standard filter press application for metal hydroxide sludge,for example,with plates that provide a 32mm cake thickness generally takes about 4 hours to fill.The unit is usually 80% full at about the hour mark.Due to the high pressure (100 psi from the diaphragm pump being counteracted by the 4,000 psi of hydraulic pressure),resistance builds and the diaphragm pump begins to slow down.Belt Filter Press Komline SandersonA Belt Filter Press is a sludge dewatering device that applies mechanical pressure to a chemically conditioned slurry,which is sandwiched between two (2) tensioned belts,by passing those belts through a serpentine of decreasing diameter rolls.
