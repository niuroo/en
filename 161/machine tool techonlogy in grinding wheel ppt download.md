## High speed CNC grinding
During grinding,the effect of wear on the grinding wheel has an impact on the accuracy of the finished workpiece.This effect is exaggerated on longer grinding processes.To counter this and ensure consistent accuracy,your CNC needs to be able to compensate for wear by adjusting the position and speed of the grinding wheel.MP 1 Grinding MachineMP 1 Grinding Machine 1.Grinding machine is a power operated machine tool where,the work piece is fed against a constantly rotating abrasive wheel which is also called as Grinding wheel so that a thin layer of material is removed from the work piece.A small grinding wheel performs the necessary grinding with its peripheral surface.

GRINDING MACHINE 3.Introduction • A grinding machine,often shortened to grinder,is any of various power tools or machine tools used for grinding,which is a type of machining using an abrasive wheel as the cutting tool.Each grain of abrasive on the wheel's surface cuts a small chip from the work piece via shear deformation.Grinding MachinesGrinding machines,like broaching machines,operate over a range of speeds depending on the type of machine being used.These range from approximately 1250 to 2000m min −1,although in high speed grinding speeds of up to 5400m min are achievable (Schey,1987).).
