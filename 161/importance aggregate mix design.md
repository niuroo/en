## Aggregates: A Vital Component of Your Mix Design
When aggregate properties vary from the intended mix design,the concrete can be affected in dramatic ways,altering workability,air content,hardened properties,finish,density and more.And even though the majority of precasters understand the importance of aggregates for concrete strength and durability,failure to meet aggregate testing requirements remains an issue for some.Exposed Aggregate for TiltUp ConcreteYour recent tiltup articles (September 1987,page 831) mentioned several ways to produce exposed aggregate surfaces,without commenting on the importance of mix design.

## Aggregate in Concrete
Mix design calculations are conducted assuming aggregates are in a saturated surface dry (SSD) condition,meaning their absorption is satisfied and no water is taken from or added to the mix.If their absorption is not satisfied,these &quot;sponges&quot; steal water from the designated quantity of mix water,reducing the slump of the concrete.
