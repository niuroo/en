## Iron Smelting Essential Humanities
An alloy is formed by mixing a metal with one or more other elements.Thus,steel and cast iron are actually iron carbon alloys.Adding carbon to iron makes it harder,yet more brittle.The extraction of metal from an oxide ore is accomplished via smelting,a process in which ore is mixed with some form of carbon fuel (e.g.charcoal) in a low oxygen chamber.SmeltingSmelting is the process that the ore of a metal goes through in order to obtain the metal as a single element or compound.This process has many subsections,but the most common one is called pyrometallurgical smelting,in which the metal is separated from excess and unwanted materials through the usage of high temperatures.
