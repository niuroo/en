## CHAPTER 7 Mine site rehabilitation
17&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;CHAPTER 7 Mine site rehabilitation 7.1 Introduction The Mining Act stipulates that a rehabilitation and restoration plan must be approved prior to the issuance of a mining lease,required to begin mining activities.This plan namely describes the type of restoration work to be performed and the total amount of the financial guarantee to be paid.Tailing DisposalDavid John Williams,in Ground Improvement Case Histories,2015.2.4 Beaching behavior of mine tailings.The predominant method of tailings disposal is by pumping and sub aerial deposition of an aqueous slurry (typically at 30 45% initial solids concentration by mass and an initial gravimetric moisture content,w,of 233 122%) to a surface TSF.The tailings may be discharged from a single.

## Ecological restoration alters microbial communities in.
Ecological restoration of mine tailings have impact on soil physiochemical properties and microbial communities.The surface soil has been a primary concern in the past decades,however it remains poorly understood about the adaptive response of microbial communities along the profile during ecological restoration of the tailings.Tailings3&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Tailings are the materials left over after the process of separating the valuable fraction from the uneconomic fraction of an ore.Tailings are distinct from overburden,which is the waste rock or other material that overlies an ore or mineral body and is displaced during mining without being processed.The extraction of minerals from ore can be done two ways: placer mining,which uses water.
