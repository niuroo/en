## Cement mill
A cement mill (or finish mill in North American usage) is the equipment used to grind the hard,nodular clinker from the cement kiln into the fine grey powder that is cement.Most cement is currently ground in ball mills and also vertical roller mills which are more effective than ball mills.The relationship between low process yield and equipment.When the output of cement powder mill is not high,the product fineness is coarse,it indicates that the material flow rate in the mill is too fast,the grinding ability is too strong,and the grinding ability is not enough,which is caused by the too large average ball diameter.At this time should be appropriate to reduce the large ball.

## What is slag cement
Slag cement is a hydraulic cement formed when granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS) is ground to suitable fineness and is used to replace a portion of portland cement.It is a recovered industrial by product of an iron blast furnace.Molten slag diverted from the iron blast furnace is rapidly chilled,producing glassy granules that yield.How will the cement plant of the future be?Today cement goes so far as demand,production costs and transport permit,in the future they will be based on the kg CO2 kg Cement.In order to decrease the CO2 generated by transport,plant size will depend on the demand for cement in a radius no greater than 300 km.
