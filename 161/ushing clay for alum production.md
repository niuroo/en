## Studies into the preparation of alum from slime waste …
Acquah et al.(1999) have reported their investigation on the use of the Awaso bauxite for alum production.During mining operations at the Awaso,material from the pits is usually passed through a washing plant to remove fines and impurities such as plant material and adhering clay.Alum and Ferric Chloride: Pros,Cons,and Substitutes for …Alum and ferric chloride are widely used commodity coagulants.Many water treaters don't know that alternative,often more cost effective,products exist.How are alum and ferric chloride used in water treatment? As every water treater knows,coagulants are used in.

## Potassium alum
Potassium alum,potash alum,or potassium aluminium sulfate is a chemical compound: the double sulfate of potassium and aluminium,with chemical formula KAl(SO4)2.It is commonly encountered as the dodecahydrate,KAl(SO4)2&#183;12H2O.It crystallizes in cubic structure with space group P a and lattice parameter of 12.18 &#197;.[4] The compound is.Production Of Liquid Alum Coagulant From Local Saudi ClaysAl Zahrani and Abdel Majid,(2004),studied the production of liquid alum from local Saudi clay and their results revealed that the optimum conditions for 90.9% Al 2 O 3 to be produced were: 700 0.
