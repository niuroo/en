## Dephosphorization of high carbon ferromanganese …
Manganese is added to steel in the form of ferromanganese to improve the rolling and forging qualities,strength,toughness,stiffness,wear resistance and hardenability.It is also used extensively as a deoxidizer.In view of its wide applications,the consumption of ferromanganese is more than that of all other ferroalloys combined.However,ferromanganese is one of the main sources of.Effect of Al2O3 on Enrichment of Phosphorus in Hot Metal,the enrichment of phosphorus,especially the reaction mechanism of the enrichment,in dephosphorization slag by Al 2O 3 modification Therefore,in the present study,the ultimate goal is to study the effect of Al 2O 3 on enrichment of phosphorus in hot metal dephosphorization slag (high phosphorus slag) and explore the mechanism of the slag.
