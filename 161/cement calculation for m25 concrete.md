## Quantity analysis for Materials In 1 cu.m Cement Concrete …
Concrete is basically a heterogeneous mixture,which consists of cement,sand,stone aggregates and water.For a big project,where the higher grade of concrete is used,mix design is must to determine the quantities of the materials required to maintain the grade.But when a lesser grade of concrete is used,quantity analysis for Cement,Sand And Aggregate is done by some basic calculation.
