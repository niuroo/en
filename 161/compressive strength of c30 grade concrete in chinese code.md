## Influence of Air Content on the Compressive Strength of …
The influence of air content on compressive strength of C20，C30，C40 and C50 concrete was investigated in this paper.The result shows that this relationship varied with concrete strength grade.For C20~C40 concrete,the air content increases with addition of air.Recycling and reuse of waste concrete in China : Part I,However,due to the local conditions in China,only RACs lower than C40 are permitted in the current technical code (DG TJ 07 008) although it is feasible to produce high strength concrete with RCA (Chen and Lü,2003)
