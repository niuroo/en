## Free Standing Nano particle Formation by Ball Milling at Cryogenic.
However,such particles were prepared by chemical synthesis routes.The bulk preparation of such particle is not reported in the literature.It is expected that ball milling at low temperature can be used for such preparation process.Therefore,it is imperative to understand the synthesis of free standing nanoparticles of&nbsp;.Mechanical Milling: a Top Down Approach for the …2017 12 1&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Firstly they milled the commercially available (0.7 μm) boron carbide (B 4 C) particles,in a attritor ball mill and prepared B 4 C nano particles.Secondly the mechanical alloying was employed to synthesize metal matrix composite powders with a nanocrystalline Al 6061 alloy as the matrix and B 4 C as the reinforcement.
