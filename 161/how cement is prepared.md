## How concrete is made
Concrete made with Portland cement is considered superior to that made with natural cement because it is stronger,more durable,and of more consistent quality.According to the American Society of Testing of Materials (ASTM),Portland cement is made by mixing calcareous (consisting mostly of calcium carbonate) material such as limestone with silica ,alumina ,and iron oxide containing materials.Low Heat CementLow heat cement is a special tailored cement which generates low heat of hydration during setting.It is manufactured by modifying the chemical composition of normal Portland cement.In this article we discuss about the composition,properties,characteristics,uses and advantages of low heat cement.
