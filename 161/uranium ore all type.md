In addition to the copper and cobalt deposits (Kamoto type),uranium and nickel deposits are present in South Shaba.The most important of these is the Shinkolobwe ore body.UraniumUranium is a chemical element with the symbol U and atomic number 92.It is a silvery grey metal in the actinide series of the periodic table.A uranium atom has 92 protons and 92 electrons,of which 6 are valence electrons.Uranium is weakly radioactive because all isotopes of uranium are unstable; the half lives of its naturally occurring isotopes range between 159,200 years and 4.5 billion years.
