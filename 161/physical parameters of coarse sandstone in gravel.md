## Grain size
Grain size (or particle size) is the diameter of individual grains of sediment,or the lithified particles in clastic rocks.The term may also be applied to other granular materials.This is different from the crystallite size,which refers to the size of a single crystal inside a particle or grain.inside a particle or grain.Sedimentary succession and recognition marks of …A interval,the bottom of the sedimentary succession,is dominated by coarse sand and gravel,which are sub rounded,poor sorted,massive,and the gravel oriented floating in the coarse sand ().The thickness of A interval is the largest in the succession,generally 20cm to 40cm,because the wave asymmetric zone generally is tens meters in width.
