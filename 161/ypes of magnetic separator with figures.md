## Separator an overview ScienceDirect Topics
L.Zhang,in Encyclopedia of Materials: Science and Technology,2001.1.5 Separators.Separators generally serve two primary functions: (i) keeping the positive electrode physically apart from the negative in order to prevent any electronic current passing between them,and (ii) permitting an ionic current with the least possible hindrance.To meet the two opposing requirements,the separator.Separation of enantiomers by their enantiospecific. · There are two common ways to distinguish mirror image molecules,or enantiomers.The first relies on their distinct interactions with circularly polarized light,the second on their interactions with a pure enantiomer of some other molecule.Now Banerjee Ghosh et al.report a conceptually different approach to chiral resolution.Experiments showed that,depending on the direction of.
