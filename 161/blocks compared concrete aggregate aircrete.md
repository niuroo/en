## Cracking up: The Trouble with Aircrete Blocks
Another bit of advice is that Aircrete blocks should ideally be laid with a sand cement lime mix of around 6.1.1 or even 8.1.1 for Solar blocks.If you look at how much lime a builders merchant sells compared to the number of Aircrete blocks he shifts you will see that very few people follow this recipe.Foundations Cost and Time Benefits of Using Aircrete …This can be achieved due to the laying rate of our Foundation blocks which is almost twice as fast as two skins of 100mm dense concrete blocks and up to four times faster than bricks.The weight of a Celcon block is less than half that of a dense aggregate concrete block,therefore Celcon blocks are easily handled and laid,offering considerable improvements in productivity.

Concrete blockwork can generally be divided into three categories: dense aggregate,light aggregate,and cellular aircrete,sometimes known as aerated concrete.Dense aggregate blocks consist of cement,sand and various aggregates,such as barite,magnetite,iron or lead pellets,and has a typical thermal conductivity of 0.70 1.30 W mK.Autoclaved aerated concreteAutoclaved aerated concrete (AAC) is a lightweight,precast,foam concrete building material suitable for producing concrete masonry unit (CMU) like blocks.Composed of quartz sand,calcined gypsum,lime,cement,water and aluminum powder,AAC products are cured under heat and pressure in an autoclave.
