## Sediment transport Wikipedia
Sediment transport is the movement of solid particles (),typically due to a combination of gravity acting on the sediment,and or the movement of the fluid in which the sediment is entrained Sediment transport occurs in natural systems where the particles are clastic rocks (sand,gravel,boulders,etc),mud,or clay; the fluid is air,water,or ice; and the force of gravity acts to move the.A Life Cycle Inventory of Limestone Dimension Stone,Process flow diagram for limestone processing operations Processing commences with transportation of the (raw) stone from the quarry to the processing facility,as depicted by Figure 2 It should be noted that this step may consist of multiple transportation steps; prior to reaching the doors of the facility,the stone may be transferred to a
