## Designing a Conveyor System
The Conveyor Design To solve a conveyor problem,certain facts must first be known.This information is essential for sound conveyor engineering: tonnage per hour,average size of material,maximum lump sizes,weight of material in pounds per cubic foot,conveyor pulley centers in feet,whether conveyor is to operate horizontally or on an incline (18 should be the maximum inclination) and.Alligator For Belt ConveyorAlligator For Belt Conveyor Choose from our selection of alligator belt lacing including lacing for conveyor belts alligator lacing sets for flat belts and more In stock and ready to ship Powder Grinding Production Line Materials are conveyed to the storage bin by the.

## Chute Design Essentials How to Design and Implement …
The area of the chute containing the body of the material flow must be at least 2.5 to 3.0 times the area of the material,based on the design capacity of the conveyor and the material speed at the point of consideration.Conveyor DynamicsFigures 10b and 10c (top view of 10b) illustrates an improved upper chute design for proper bin loading.This achieves symmetric flow onto the receiving belt and eliminates direct drop belt impact.Fig.10 Ore directional loading into bin and onto conveyor and controlled directional drop into bin,positioned

## Belt Conveyor Transfer Points
Proper belt loading is primarily determined by the engineering and design of the conveyor transfer point.General Design Considerations In the preliminary study of a material handling system involving belt conveyors,the number of belt transfer points should be reduced to a minimum in order to reduce degradation,dust and cost.Chute Design&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;There is a wealth of information available on chute design,see notes by Alan Roberts on the web.Generally,these favour 'leading' the flow stream in a way to minimise impact and suit the following process,i.e.matching the linear speed of a receiving belt conveyor.
