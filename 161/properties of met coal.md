## What is Coking Coal
The Chinese coking coal market is likely to be the largest consumer for Ovoot coking coal due to its size and proximity.Premium coking coals such as Fat (Ovoot coal) and Primary coals,are in particular high demand within China primarily due to the low ratio of these coals in China’s own coal reserves but also due to the growing requirement for higher quality coking coals in the coke industry.Metallurgical Coal IspatGuruMetallurgical coal is also called ‘met coal’ or ‘coking coal.It is a bituminous coal which allows the production of a coke suitable to support a blast furnace (BF) charge.It is distinguished by the strong low density coke produced when the coal is heated in a low oxygen (O2) environment or in absence of air to reduce mineral impurities (e.g.less sulphur,phosphorus).
