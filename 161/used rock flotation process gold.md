## Gold CIL process
The gold CIL process is mainly used in the oxide ore which has low grade of silver,its more economize and has more benefit.Process introduction CIL process is mainly include : decontaminate,concentrate before leaching,leaching and adsorption,desorption and electrowinning,hydrometallurgy,regeneration of activated carbon ， tailings filting,waste water treatement and so on.Froth Flotation MethodThe froth flotation method is widely used to treat various veins of gold and silver ores for the following reasons: (1) In most cases,the froth flotation process can enrich gold and silver in sulfide concentrate to the greatest extent and discard a large number of tailings,thus reducing the smelting cost.
