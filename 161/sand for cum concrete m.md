## how we calculate of Sand,cement and aggregate of M20.
M20 (1 cement :1.5 sand :3 stone brick aggregate).To determine the proportions you have to perform mix design,for this you have to find out the sp.gr.of cement,CA,FA,and water cement ratio,type of exposure,Maximum size of aggregate etc.Once the W C ratio is determined use 186 kg water (for 20mm CA) to find out the qty.of cement per cum of concrete.how much cement sand aggregate is required for cum mhow much cement sand aggregate is required … How much sand and aggregate required 1 cubic meter,And dry volume factor is 54 percent Hence,we required to find quantities for 154 cum concrete Ans : Approximately 6 to 62 bags of cement per cubic meter of concrete \n The qty of cement will depend on other raw materials( viz coarse aggreagate.
