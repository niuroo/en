## Shaped Charge
The mechanism of jet formation in the shaped charge is complex,but the basic principles can be found in other publications [9,10].On the basis of shock wave theory we may also explain why a jet can be formed in a shaped charge.As shown in Fig.25.3,when the detonator is fired,a shock wave followed by the chemical reaction is formed and it travels outward from the detonator position.How to Make Black Powder SafelyWhile there are different grades of black powder,it's made using the same three basic chemicals: potassium nitrate,charcoal,sulfur in a 6:1:1 or 6:1.2:0.8 ratio or about 75% potassium nitrate,15% charcoal,and 10% sulfur.The ratio of these chemicals may be slightly adjusted to affect how quickly it burns,but mainly that is determined by how finely ground the gunpowder is.
