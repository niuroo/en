## Mining
Mining chemical use can be expected to provide even stronger growth,since the industry is faced with lower grade ores which require larger amounts of chemical products in their processing.Increasing requirements for environmental and health protection in the industry also require increasing use of chemicals,i.e.in dust control,and the more efficient use of in many cases scarce water.Mercury in gold mining poses toxic threatThe darting liquid metal wraps itself around the gold to form a silver pellet the size of a marble.The use of mercury in gold mining is illegal in Indonesia because it is toxic to both human.
