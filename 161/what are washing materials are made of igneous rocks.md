Igneous rocks are divided into two groups,intrusive or extrusive,depending upon where the molten rock solidifies.Extrusive igneous rock Ex trusive,or volcanic,igneous rock is produced when magma ex its and cools outside of,or very near the Earth's surface.The Earth's Crust University Of IllinoisThe most common minerals are those that have a chemical composition made of the common elements found in their environment.The Earth's crust is made up of about 95% igneous and metamorphic rocks,4% shale,0.75% sandstone,and 0.25% limestone.

## Pictures and Descriptions of Igneous Rock Types
Igneous rocks are those that form via the process of melting and cooling If they erupt from volcanoes onto the surface as lava,they are called extrusive rocksBy contrast,Intrusive rocks are formed from magma that cools underground If the intrusive rock cooled underground but near the surface,it is called subvolcanic or hypabyssal,and often has visible,but tiny mineral,Sedimentary rock WikipediaMost sedimentary rocks contain either quartz (especially siliciclastic rocks) or calcite (especially carbonate rocks) In contrast to igneous and metamorphic rocks,a sedimentary rock usually contains very few different major minerals However,the origin of the minerals in a sedimentary rock is often more complex than in an igneous rock

## Igneous Rock: Face of the Earth
Igneous rock is rock formed by the hardening and crystallization of molten material that originates deep within the earth.The word "igneous" comes from the Greek word for fire; some people call igneous rock a fire ball rock.Rocks that have hardened from magma,the hot liquid beneath the earth's crust,are called igneous rocks.
