## Emissions from the Cement Industry
Though “cement” and “concrete” are often used interchangeably,concrete is actually the final product made from cement.The primary component of cement is limestone.To produce cement,limestone and other clay like materials are heated in a kiln at 1400&#176;C and then ground to form a lumpy,solid substance called clinker; clinker is then combined with gypsum to form cement.why bauxite used in cement industryBauxite and Alumina USGS Mineral Resources Program The bulk of world bauxite production is,therefore,used as feed.refractories and abrasives,followed by cement applications.Bauxite Mineral,Bauxite Information,Uses of Bauxite,Bauxite Suppliers The bulk.

## Cement clinker
Cement clinker is a solid material produced in the manufacture of Portland cement as an intermediary product.Clinker occurs as lumps or nodules,usually 3 millimetres (0.12 in) to 25 millimetres (0.98 in) in diameter.It is produced by sintering (fusing together without melting to the point of liquefaction) limestone and aluminosilicate materials such as clay during the cement kiln stage.HomeCalcined Bauxite Location: XINMI,HENAN1999 2000Factory Put into practice officially Refractory Brick Castable Location: XINMI,HENAN 3rd&amp;4th new shaft kiln&amp;EAF built High Purity Calcined Bauxite Location: XINMI,HENAN 2009 20155th&amp;6th EAF
