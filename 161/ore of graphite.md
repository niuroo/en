## Graphite: Mineral information,data and localities.
Graphite usually occurs in flakes in metamorphosed rocks rich in carbon,but it can also be found in veins and in pegmatites.Where large deposits are found it is mined and used as an industrial lubricant and for 'lead' in pencils.The crystallinity depends on theFlotation studies on graphite ores of Shivaganga areas,…Graphite ore is mostly beneficiated using flotation separation techniques.The increasing demand for high grade graphite products with up to 99.99% carbon has resulted in the development of.
