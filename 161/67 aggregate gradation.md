## Gradation and Size
The particle size distribution,or gradation,of an aggregate is one of the most influential aggregate characteristics in determining how it will perform as a pavement material.In HMA,gradation helps determine almost every important property including stiffness,stability,durability,permeability,workability,fatigue resistance,frictional resistance and moisture susceptibility (Roberts et.SIEVE ANALYSIS OF FINE AND COARSE AGGREGATES AASHTO T 271 SIEVE ANALYSIS OF FINE AND COARSE AGGREGATES AASHTO T 27 SCOPE The sieve analysis,commonly known as the gradation test,is a basic essential test for all aggregate technicians.The sieve analysis determines the gradation (the
