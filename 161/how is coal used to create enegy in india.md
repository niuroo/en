## How much coal is required to generate 1 MWH of electricity.
The quality of coal.Since we are converting the energy in coal to electricity,we need to know the energy content of coal.A quick googling tells me that the energy content of coal is given in terms of MegaJoules (Mj) per Kilogram (kg) of coal as the Gross calorific value (GCV) or the Higher Heating value (HHV).This value can vary from 10.50.How does coal produce electricity Answers.comCoal makes energy in 6 sorta simple steps.1) The coal or natural gas is first burned for mainly thermal (or heat) energy.2) That thermal energy is used to boil water and to produce steam.3) That steam is then forced through a high pressure tube called a steam line.4) The steam then pushes a turbine (which is very electrical and i don't know what goes on in there)5) That turbine then produces.
