## How can I get rust and mill scale off of a hot rolled plate
 · Even course sand has limited ability to chip off the mill scale.Hand grinding or the use of a wire wheel will not reliably remove mill scale.It will mask it.Once the mill scale surface is abraided,it looks just the same as clean steel.Acid treatment does remove rust,but not scale with all the downside already mentioned by others.NATIONAL SLAG MF 205 1 ASSOCIATION2019 12 15&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;NATIONAL SLAG MF 205 1 ASSOCIATION Page 1 Water Improvement Initiatives in New Zealand Using Melter Slag Filter Beds Bill Bourke,SteelServ Ltd,Auckland,New Zealand ABSTRACT The ability of iron and steel industry slag aggregates to remove phosphorous and

## Researchers create stronger concrete from steel slag …
Steel slag used in wastewater treatment has been proven to create stronger concrete than conventional concrete aggregates,according to a new study from RMIT University.Steel slag is a by product of smelted ore and has been used as a substitute aggregate for making concrete in the past.Common Uses for Slag National Slag AssociationBy passing the molten slag through high volume high pressure water sprays,a glassy,sand Type (granulated) material Is formed,known as Granulated Blast Furnace SIag.The color of this product is very similar to normal beach sand.The principal use is as Cement replacement (when ground),replacing 30 50% of Portland Cement in 'normal' concrete.

## Uses,Benefits,and Drawbacks of Fly Ash in Construction
Fly ash can be a cost effective substitute for Portland cement in many markets.Fly ash is also recognized as an environmentally friendly material because it is a byproduct and has low embodied energy,the measure of how much energy is consumed in producing and shipping a building material.By contrast,Portland cement has a very high embodied energy because its production requires a great deal.Choosing the Right Blast Media for Abrasive BlastingThe shape of the article effects how deeply it cuts into the coating and underlying substrate.Shapes are classified according to angularity.Angular particles cut through soft coatings and rust,cleaning faster,and producing sharper anchor patterns.Rounded particles produce a more even,peened surf
