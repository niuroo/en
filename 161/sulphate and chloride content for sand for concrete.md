## Chloride in concrete (BS 8500)
BS 8500 Concrete Complementary British Standard to BS EN 206 requires that concrete should have a maximum chloride ion content by mass of cement depending on certain criteria.This is expressed as a chloride class e.g.Cl 0,40 The use of a comma,instead of a full stop.is how it is expressed in the main Standard BS EN 206.Sulphate And Chloride Content For Sand For Concrete,Sulphate And Chloride Content For Sand For Concrete Dec 01 2015 It is clear from Fig 1 that the BS 8500 BS 8500 1 2006 total chloride limit as a percentage by weight of cement for reinforced heat curing concrete and prestressed concrete 01 are easily violated with concrete mix designs that have wc greater than 04
