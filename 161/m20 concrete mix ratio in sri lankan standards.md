## Designing and Proportioning Normal Concrete,
Designing and Proportioning Normal Concrete Mixtures SELECTING MIX CHARACTERISTICS Before a concrete mixture can be proportioned,mixture,cementitious materials ratio and mixture proportions for the required strength should be based on adequate field data orSlump Test for Fresh ConcreteWorkability is a key property of the fresh concrete for all the types of the concrete.Workability defines as a measure of consistency of the fresh concrete or simply can be explained as it is about how easily the concrete can be poured into the mold and compacted to form the required shape without any segregation and defects with the required strength and durability.
