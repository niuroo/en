## The Making of Iron & Steel SEAISI
Iron ore,as mined,is a combination of iron with oxygen and various other unwanted substances,generally known as "gangue" The first metallurgical step is to reduce iron ore to metallic iron,a process which is mostly carried out in a blast furnace,using coke as both a fuel and reducing agentHot Briquetted Iron (HBI)Hot Briquetted Iron (HBI) Is a premium form of DRI that has been compacted at a temperature greater than 650&#176; C at time of compaction and has a density greater,

## Direct Reduced Iron
2.1 Midrex Process Midrex is the most successful gas based DR process; it is a continuous process.It is basically a countercurrent process where a hot and highly reducing gas (95vol.% of this gas mixture being hydrogen and carbon monoxide with a ratio of H 2:CO varying from 1.5 to 1.6) reduces lump iron ore or pellets to metallic iron as the metallic charge descends through the top portion of.IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering PAPER …The mechanical properties of briquette and iron ore are given in table 6.The cold compressive strength of briquette after natural curing at different days are shown in figure 5.For getting the mechanical properties which are shown in table 6,the briquette and iron
