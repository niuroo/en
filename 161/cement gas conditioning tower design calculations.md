## Cooling tower
A cooling tower is a heat rejection device that rejects waste heat to the atmosphere through the cooling of a water stream to a lower temperature.Cooling towers may either use the evaporation of water to remove process heat and cool the working fluid to near the wet bulb air temperature or,in the case of closed circuit dry cooling towers,rely solely on air to cool the working fluid to near.Gas Conditioning Towers Redecam GroupGas conditioning towers (GCT) are used in industrial applications to cool gases upstream,ahead of bag filters,electrostatic precipitators or our Dual Action Filters.They are considered to be the most effective type of cooling systems in treating exhaust process gases.Our GCTs offer unequalled effectiveness: our team has three decades of experience designing these towers
