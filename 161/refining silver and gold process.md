## Refining Silver and Gold Another Fearless Year
Through the refining process they extract and mold the pure gold and silver by removing all of the impurities in the ore.This process involves fire and the close attention of the smith.The smith puts the ore in the fire to burn out some of the impurities,then takes it out and shapes it,then back in the fire.Gold processingGold processing Gold processing Refining: Gold extracted by amalgamation or cyanidation contains a variety of impurities,including zinc,copper,silver,and iron.Two methods are commonly employed for purification: the Miller process and the Wohlwill process.The Miller process is based on the fact that virtually all the impurities present in gold combine with gaseous chlorine more.
