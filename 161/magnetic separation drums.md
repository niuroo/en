## A simultaneous separation of magnetic and conductive ‚Ä¶
The aim of this work is the investigation of the simultaneous separation of magnetic (ùúár &gt; 80) and conductive (ùúé ‚âà 6 &#215;107 S m) particles in a designed magnetic separator.Such a separator consists mainly of a drum on which permanent magnets areIndustrial Magnetics,Inc.Home Tramp Metal Conveyor Line Drum Separator IMI's Magnetic Drum Separators provide ferrous metal removal from dry,bulk products in free flowing processing systems.Due to the nature of their design,magnetic drum separators are continuously self cleaning units,and can be provided as the drum only or as a complete assembly with the housing and drive included.

## Magnetic separation
During magnetic separation,magnets are situated inside two separator drums which bear liquids.Due to the magnets,magnetic particles are being drifted by the movement of the drums.This can create a magnetic concentrate (e.g.an ore concentrate).
