## Features Of Sag Mills
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;SAG is an acronym for Semi Autogenous Grinding,which means that it utilizes steel balls in addition to large rocks for grinding.It has a large diameter and short lAutogenous and Semi Autogenous MillsThe mill capacity can be estimated by dividing 90% of the gross mill power by the net grinding power per tonne from the test mill.Several workers have attempted to determine the power dra

## Autogenous mill and semi autogenous mill
The AG SAG mill is normally installed upstream of a tube mill operating in closed circuit with hydrocyclones.The material discharged from the AG SAG mill is either fed directly to the tube mill or first screened.If a screen is used,the screen overflow of the AG SAG mill is returned for further grinding either directly or via a crusher.(PDF) SAG mill circuit optimisation at Ernest Henry Mininghydrocyclone underflow to be recycled back to the SAG mill feed.• In stallation of a limited variable speed capability for the SAG mill.(Installed December 1998).
