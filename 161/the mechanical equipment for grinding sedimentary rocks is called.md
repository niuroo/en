Mechanical weathering can involve erosional grinding as fast moving flood waters moves boulders and sediments down stream valleys and where wave action batters rocks into sand along a shoreline.Rocks are shattered by earthquakes and volcanic explosions,the expand and split when erosion unloads overburden on compressed rocks that were previously deeply buried.Technofile: Geology for PottersRocks Rocks can be classified into three types: igneous,metamorphic,and sedimentary.The igneous rocks most useful to potters are felsic (yielding feldspars and silica) which are found together with mica in rock aggregates such as granite.Mica is …

## Sedimentary rock
Sedimentary rocks are types of rock that are formed by the accumulation or deposition of small particles and subsequent cementation of mineral or organic particles on the floor of oceans or other bodies of water at the Earth's surface.Sedimentation is the collective name for processes that cause these particles to settle in place.What are three different ways that rocks can be worn …The breaking down of rocks by construction equipment might be called mechanical weathering.This process is different than the mechanical weathering that occurs when rocks are broken down by ice.
