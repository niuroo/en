## The world’s highest grade gold mines
With 44.1 g t of gold in reserves,Fire Creek mine,owned by Klondex Mines and located in Nevada,United States,is believed to be the highest grade underground gold mine in the world.2.Porphyry copper depositPorphyry deposits represent an important resource of copper; however,they are also important sources of gold and molybdenum with porphyry deposits being the dominant source of the latter.In general,porphyry deposits are characterized by low grades of ore mineralization,a porphyritic intrusive complex that is surrounded by a vein stockwork and hydrothermal breccias.[7]

Abstract Archean lode gold deposits of the Canadian Shield have commonly been regarded as “structurally controlled,” although the precise nature of such control has been the subject of much debate.Prior to about 1975,these deposits were either considered fault.Epithermal Gold for ExplorationistsOnly by knowing what type of deposits we are dealing with,can explorationists evaluate the economics of any project,and importantly,search for more ore.Corbett: Epithermal Gold For Explorationists Paper 01,April 2002 2 Figure 1.
