## TAKRAF addresses the role of Dry Stack Tailings
The use of the Dry Stack Tailings (DST) is increasingly recognized as a method of mitigating the risks,both technical and financial,associated with wet tailings impoundments.“It is worth noting,” Blois says,“that the DST approach is not new; in 1909,Harry Adams described the use of DST for tailings disposal at Kalgoorlie,Western Australia.”Iron ore tailings dry stacking in Pau Branco mine,Brazil2014,[2]).Dewatered stockpiling (dry stacking) is a safer alternative to tailings dams (Rico et al.2008,[3]) for tailings disposal; however,this method has not yet been used in iron ore mines in Brazil,where geotechnical conditions and abundance of water are for
