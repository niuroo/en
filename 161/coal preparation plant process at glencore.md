## What Is Coal Preparation?
What Is Coal Preparation? • Coal preparation is the removal of undesirable material from the Run of Mine (ROM) coal by employing separation processes which are able to differentiate between the physical and surface properties of the coal and the impurities.ProductionAt Ravensworth Surface Operations,coal is hauled from the mining areas to the ROM pad and dump hopper via internal coal haul roads.The coal is crushed by rotary sizers before being transported by parallel conveyor belt systems to either the Ravensworth Coal Handling Preparation Plant for export,or to the Bayswater and Liddell Power stations for domestic power generation.

## Coal processing
The Coal Handling and Preparation Plant produces semi soft coking coal and thermal product coal,which are placed separately on the product coal stockpile.Up to 1.5 Mtpa of ROM coal can be received or delivered from,or to,the nearby Cumnock No.1 Colliery for washing and processing when spare capacity is available at either operation.
