## Extracting metals from rocks Resource RSC Education
Class practical Malachite is a copper ore consisting mainly of basic copper(II) carbonate,CuCO 3.Cu(OH) 2.This experiment involves producing copper from copper(II) carbonate.The copper carbonate is first heated to produce copper(II) oxide,which is then reduced to the metal using carbon as a reducing agent.Is copper,bauxite,malachite,carmelite,or cedarite?Is it what? Are you asking if copper is one of the other 4 materials? If so,than the answer is no,copper is an element,and when kept relatively pure it is an excellent conductor and material for all types of wiring.Adding pretty much anything.
