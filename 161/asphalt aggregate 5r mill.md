## Asphalt Milling
Asphalt milling is the controlled removal and recycling of an existing asphalt pavement layer to correct and restore the surface to a specified profile.The process generates recycled asphalt pavement (RAP) for use in place of virgin aggregate in new asphalt material.The Complete 7 Step Process for Asphalt Pavement Installation&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;The binder layer is large aggregate mixed with oil,making it very strong and durable.The binder layer can be thought of as the strength of any new asphalt surface.Step 6: Install New Asphalt Surface.Once the supportive structures of a new asphalt surface are installed,the top layer of fresh asphalt is added to provide a clean,smooth ride.

## Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement
When properly crushed and screened,RAP consists of high quality,well graded aggregates coated by asphalt cement.Asphalt pavement is generally removed either by milling or full depth removal.Milling entails removal of the pavement surface using a milling machine,which can remove up to 50 mm (2 in) thickness in a single pass.Asphalt MillingAsphalt milling will NOT prevent reflective cracking if there is cracks in the base layer of asphalt or if there is vertical movement in the asphalt base layer from unstable subgrade.Some asphalt contractors will lead you to believe milling the surface layer of asphalt in a badly cracked deteriorated parking lot will prevent reflective.
