## Alkaline sulfide gold leaching kinetics
Recently,leaching of gold with cyanide has come under scrutiny for its possible detrimental effects to the environment.Also,in some gold bearing ores and concentrates,conventional cyanide leaching is not the best method for gold extraction.This is due to gold.A review of gold extraction using noncyanide lixiviants: …The kinetics of gold leaching using alkaline sulfur containing lixiviants has received extensive attention because these materials are potential alternatives to cyanide.Jeffrey and Anderson [ 72 ] speculated that the dissolution of gold in alkaline sulfide solutions was chemically controlled rather than diffusion controlled and was highly dependent on temperature.
