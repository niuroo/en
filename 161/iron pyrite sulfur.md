## Pyrite Oxidation Mechanism by Oxygen in Aqueous Medium
Surface.The cleavage of pyrite occurs along the (100) plane (Figure 1a) direction through Fe−S bond breaking.As shown in Figure 1b,c,fold iron sites and fold sulfur sites are formed on the surface.All S−S bonds remain intact in the ideal cleavage.Figure 1Pyrite sulfur isotopes reveal glacial interglacial201762&ensp&#0183&enspA total of 131 pyrite sulfur isotopes analyses have been performed along the 300m PRGL14 core,spanning the last five glacial−interglacialtransitions(Fig.S1 and Table S1).Throughout thecore,pyrite shows extreme variationsin δ34S,from −44.0‰ to 32.3‰,whereas pyrite contents vary between 0.02 wt % and 1.69 wt %.

## Pyrite: The mineral pyrite information and pictures
Pyrite was once used as a source of sulfur,but is now only a minor ore for both sulfur and iron.Pyrite from some localities is auriferous,and therefore is used as an ore of gold in goldbearing localities.Pyrite was polished by the Native Americans in the early times and used as mirrors.Today,it is used as an ornamental stone,as well as a very popular stone for amateur collectors.Journal of The Electrochemical Society 161 4651 2014 161(5) A663 5 $31.00 The Electrochemical Society Derivation of an Iron Pyrite …Historically,the reaction of iron pyrite (FeS 2) with ferrophos phorus (Fe 2P) at temperatures between 700 800 C was thought to produce P 2S 5 and FeS.16 In this two step process,FeS 2 ﬁrst thermally decomposes into FeS and S.17 Sulfur then reacts with 2
