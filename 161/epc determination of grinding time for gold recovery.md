## Gold Ore Processing ScienceDirect
Abstract The gold mining industry is presented as an overview covering key aspects and examples regarding gold discovery,deposits,and production.Segmentation of gold ore types is made based on major processing routes,ie.free milling,refractory,heap.What does cyanide leaching experiment include?At the same time,the adding mode of cyanide also influences the gold leaching rate and leaching speed to a certain extent.Therefore,on the basis of grinding fineness test,in order to further reduce the dosage of cyanidation agent and the production cost,and to determine the addition method of cyanidation agent,the dosage and addition method of cyanidation agent should be tested.
