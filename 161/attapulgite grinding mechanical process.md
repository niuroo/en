## Grinding Machining Process : Complete Notes
The grinding process has the least material removal rate among other machining processes because of the following reasons Size effect: As above discussed the machining is done by the abrasive action of grinding wheel that’s why a large portion of the abrasive will be embedded inside the wheel and a small portion of abrasive will be allowed to interact with them,therefore,less material is.
