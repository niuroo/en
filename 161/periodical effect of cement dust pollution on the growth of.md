## Dust and its Impact on Earth’s Climate System
Dust also contains iron,a limiting nutrient in many areas of the ocean,so when dust falls onto the ocean,it can act as a fertilizer for the growth of algae,or phytoplankton,which uses CO2.Dust not only affects climate,but also is influenced by it: its production,atmospheric transport and deposition are sensitive to climatic conditions.cement dust on fragaria speciespdf Mat&#233rielrelation between cement dust deposition andphysiological process in plant leaves.Since the studying area is suffering from heavy cement dust which deposits on the buildings and plants and producing asignificant adverse effect.A periodical study was carried out to study the effect of cement dust pollution on the growth of selected plant
