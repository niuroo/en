## What is a pneumatic conveying system? BulkInside
Dense Phase: Dense phase,where conveying gas velocities are typically in the range 18 m s and conveying pressures are above 1 barg.At higher conveying velocities,the material particles can still be substantially in suspension,however,at the lower velocities,the material will be predominantly in contact with the conveying pipe and will move in waves or plugs.A Quick Check Method For The Design Of Pneumatic Conveying …The design of pneumatic conveying systems is usually car ried out on the basis of scaling data obtained from the pneu.dilute phase conveying,and values above about 50 indicate that a material is capable of being conveyed at low velocity in dense phase.
