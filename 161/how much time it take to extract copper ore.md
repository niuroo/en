## Copper Mining and Processing: Processing of Copper Ores …
Copper processing is a complicated process that begins with mining of the ore (less than 1% copper) and ends with sheets of 99.99% pure copper called cathodes,which will ultimately be made into products for everyday use.The most common types of ore,copper oxide and copper sulfide,undergo two different processes,hydrometallurgy and pyrometallurgy,respectively,due to the different.CopperIt would lift ore production six fold to produce 0.75 Mtpa of refined copper from a total resource of almost 80 Mt of contained copper.Measured Resources at the mine at June 2013 were estimated at 1470 Mt grading 1.02% Cu,0.30 kilograms per tonne (kg t) U 3 O 8,0.35 g t Au and 2 g t silver (Ag) for the sulphide ore.
