## What Hazards Are There When Using a Grinding Wheel? eHow
Poor grinding technique can result in abrasions or injuries.Among the causes are failing to hold your work correctly or brace your work agains a proper work rest; grinding on the side of a wheel not designed for that purpose; pressing too hard; forcing the grind too quickly on a cold wheel; grinding too high above the wheel center; failing to use wheel washers; or accidentally contacting.
