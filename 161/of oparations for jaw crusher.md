## Jaw Crushers Rock Crushers Aggregate Crusher.
All Lippmann Milwaukee heavy duty jaw crushers feature an oversized,heat treated shaft forged of special alloy to provide an exceptionally large eccentric throw.These heavy duty shafts are paired with two dynamically balanced flywheels,effectively reducing vibration on both portable and stationary crushers.Jaw Crusher Working PrincipleA crusher is a machine designed to reduce large rocks into smaller rocks,gravel,or rock dust.Crushers may be used to reduce the size,or change the form,of waste materials so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled,or to reduce the size of a solid mix of raw materials (as in rock ore),so that pieces of different composition can be differentiated.
