## Hard Turning Versus Grinding : Production Machining
Hard turning is often considered a replacement for grinding operations or as a pre grinding process.It is most often performed on post heat treated parts with surface hardness ranging from 45 HRC to 68 HRC or higher.Grinding,however,achieves higher tolerances.Grinding technologyThe turn grind centers combine the advantages of the turning and grinding process,such as shorter cycle times,high quality and maximum process safety.In addition,the machines benefit from the rigidity of the machine concept,which is traditionally designed for the high process forces during turning and milling and ensures tolerances down to the nearest &#181;.
