## Opening New Mines
The capital cost of mining was calculated using the equations below,where D is the daily capacity of the mine in tons of ore produced per day.The constant (i.e.first) term in each calculation is a blanket estimate based on published average initial capital investment in the industry (~USD 500 million for what is defined in this analysis as a large capacity mine) (Schuler,2011).Vat Leaching of Finely Crushed Gold OreVat leaching is carried out in vats ranging in capacity from 30 to 1200 tons.Sand for leaching is separated from slime in cones,V boxes,classifiers,and in collecting vats filled by distributors—the overflow in each case being slime or finer portion of the ore.As a rule,leaching is a simple process,involving a vat of well mixed neutralized sand,ample contact with strong and weak.
