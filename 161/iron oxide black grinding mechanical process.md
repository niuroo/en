## Black Oxide Basics
No hydrogen embrittlement: The black oxide process does not require an acid activation nor is it an electro process; therefore,hydrogen embrittlement is not a factor.If the parts are scaled or rusty and an acid pickle is required,any hydrogen that may have evolved will quickly dissipate in the black oxide tank (running temp.285 degrees F).Safety and efficacy of iron oxide black,red and yellow for …Iron oxide black is produced via chemical synthesis using iron oxide yellow (FeO(OH)) or iron oxide red (Fe 2 O 3) and or iron(II) sulfate as starting chemicals which are converted reacted in the presence of pure oxygen and caustic soda (precipitation process).
