## State of the Art Techniques for Backfilling,
State of the art techniques for backfilling abandoned mine voids byJeffrey S Walker p em (Information circular; 9359),Abandoned underground mine openings are susceptible to collapse because of the mining methods used,the character of the overburden,and the typicallylarge,wide entries with minimal roof support,givesthe backfill.Tailingsinfo Backfill of Tailings to Underground WorkingsFor example a ‘room and pillar’ mining operation that uses backfill will be able to extract the insitu pillars containing ore This is possible due to the cemented backfill acting as a support and preventing heading collapse and problems with subsidence

## Structural excavation and backfill
STRUCTURAL EXCAVATION AND BACKFILL Section 802 Earthwork forms a part of the installation procedures of box culverts,retaining walls,foundations,and substructures.In order to ensure an adequate foundation for such structures,backfill material must meet certain specifications and be compacted by acceptable methods to adequate density.Paste Thickening: Considerations for Backfill vs.Tailings …A gold mining operation in Ontario has fines that are 70% passing 20 microns and that is too fine to make a good backfill.The plant thickens and dewaters the full plant stream and 20% of that stream is mixed with 80% from local sand and gravel operations for backfill.
