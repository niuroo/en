## Deposition Jonathan Feicht's Website
Deposition is when those materials stop moving and build up somewhere else.What is a Delta and how is it formed? When rain falls and snow melts the water flows downhill and forms a river.As the water is flowing it picks up small pieces of dirt and rock,which is known as sediment.This sediment is what makes rivers look brown.When a river gets close to the ocean the land flattens out and.river National Geographic SocietyAt the same time,the river begins to leave behind some of the rocks,sand,and other solid material it collected upstream This material is called sediment Once the sediment is deposited,it is called alluvium
