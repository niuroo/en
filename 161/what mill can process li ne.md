## Milling (machining)
Milling is a cutting process that uses a milling cutter to remove material from the surface of a work piece.The milling cutter is a rotary cutting tool,often with multiple cutting points.As opposed to drilling,where the tool is advanced along its rotation axis,the cutter in milling is usually moved perpendicular to its axis so that cutting occurs on the circumference of the cutter.Feed Milling Processing Major Step in Feed Mill PlantThe process of pelleting consists of forcing a soft feed through holes in a metal die plate to form compacted pellets which are then cut to a pre dete.peanut processing.peanut cleaning equipment; peanut roasting equipment.feed pellet mill plant and complete feed pellet lin

## What are The Steps of Wheat Milling Process
The wheat plant is grown from wheat seed called the kernel.Most wheat plants grow to the height of two to four feet.The plant's part that is harvested for food production (wheat head) can yield fifty to seventy five seeds kernels.We receive enquiries in English,Espa&#241;ol (Spanish),Русский язык (Russian),Fran&#231;ais (French) and العربية (Arabic).DESIGNING A PROCESS LINE Dairy Processing HandbookThe greatest care must be taken in the selection of components as well as in the dimensioning and design of the process line.The size of the pipes in a system must be such that the velocity of the liquid does not exceed the critical value for the product (3 m s for milk,or slower for some other dairy products).
