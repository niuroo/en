## EXTRACTION OF IRON IN A BLAST FURNACE reduction haematite …
The most common ore of iron is called haematite (iron(iii) oxide).Its formula is Fe 2 O 3.Haematite is added to the top of the furnace along with coke (i.e.carbon) and limestone.Three reactions take place during this extraction.Firstly,the carbon in the blast50.8 EXTRACTION OF IRON Chemistry AssignmentThe important ores of iron are: 1.Haematite,Fe 2 O 3 (red oxide of iron) 2.Magnetite,Fe 3 O 4 (magnetic oxide of iron) 3.Iron pyrites (FeS 2) is not directly used as an ore for the extraction of iron because it contains quite high percentage of sulphur.
