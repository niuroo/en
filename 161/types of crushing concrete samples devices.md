## Crushing in Mineral Processing
In mineral processing or metallurgy,the first stage of comminution is crushing.Depending of the type of rock (geometallurgy) to be crushed,there are 2 largely different techniques at your disposition for crushing rocks.In principle,compression crushing is used on hard and abrasive rocks by placing them between a high wear resistant plate surface.Less abrasive and softer rocks or stones.Crushing 101 Masaba Masaba Inc.Track mounted crushing and screening plant: There are basically two different styles of crushers utilized in our industry: compression and impact crushers.Consequently,crushing equipment requirements can vary greatly from one location to the next even though the same finished products are being made for the same&nbsp;.
