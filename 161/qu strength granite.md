Granite is nearly always massive (i.e.lacking any internal structures),hard,and tough.These properties have made granite a widespread construction stone throughout human history.The average density of granite is between 2.65 and 2.75 g cm 3 (165 and 172 lb cu ft),its compressive strength usually lies above 200 MPa,and its viscosity near STP is 3 6&#183;10 19 Pa&#183;s.USING THE POINT LOAD TEST TO DETERMINE THE UNIAXIAL COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH …estimate uniaxial compressive strength,index to strength conversion factors are used.These factors have been proposed by various researchers and are dependent upon rock type.This study involved the extensive load frame and point load testing of coal.
