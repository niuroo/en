## Ore
Ore is natural rock or sediment that contains one or more valuable minerals,typically metals,that can be mined,treated and sold at a profit.Ore is extracted from the earth through mining and treated or refined,often via smelting,to extract the valuable metals or minerals.[1] The grade of ore refers to the concentration of the desired.Different Types of Iron OreIron Ore in Karnataka Iron ores are widely distributed.High grade ore deposits are those of Kemmangundi in Bababudan hills of Chikmagalur district and Sandur and Hospet in Bellary [Lot of Mining Mafia].Most of the ores are high grade haematite and magnetite.

## Iron ore pelletizing systems
Iron ore can be upgraded to a higher iron ore content through beneficiation.This process generates iron ore filter cake which needs to be pelletized to be used in the steel making process.Also during the processing of high grade iron ores which don’t need beneficiated,fines which are generated can be pelletized and used instead of being disposed of.Lundin Mining Corporation Eagle Mine,USA SatThe Humboldt mill property,a former iron ore processing facility,occupying approximately 142 hectares,is loed approximately 61 km west of Marquette,Michigan.
