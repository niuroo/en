## Improved Relationships for Discharge in SAG AG Mills
(SAG) mills.In order to optimize this section,the skills to accurately model and understand its underlying mechanisms are required.The literature exposed a clear lack of previous research on the influence and performance of grate pulp lifter design in AG SAG mill discharge.The current understanding fromOrway Mineral Consultants Canada Ltd.Mississauga,ON.and ball mills,have almost become obsolete in the move to higher milling rates required to process lower metal grades.Grinding circuits with fully autogenous (AG) or semi autogenous (SAG) mills,often combined with ball mills are now the standard to meet the high capacity requirement for processing ores with lower metal grades.
