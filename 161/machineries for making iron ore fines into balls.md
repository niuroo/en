## Ferrous metallurgy
Ferrous metallurgy is the metallurgy of iron and alloys.It began far back in prehistory.The earliest surviving iron artifacts,from the 4th millennium BC in Egypt,were made from meteoritic iron nickel.It is not known when or where the smelting of iron from ores began,but by the end of the 2nd millennium BC iron was being produced from iron ores from at least Greece to India,and more.(PDF) Iron Ore Pelletizing Process: An OverviewIron ore and iron ore pellets are important sources of iron for manufacturing steel.The iron ore production has significantly expanded in recent years,owing to increasing steel demands in

## Iron processing
Iron processing Iron processing Ores: Iron ores occur in igneous,metamorphic (transformed),or sedimentary rocks in a variety of geologic environments.Most are sedimentary,but many have been changed by weathering,and so their precise origin is difficult to.Iron Geoscience AustraliaIron is about eight times heavier than water (its relative density is 7.87).When iron is exposed to air it starts to turn back into iron oxide and the red powder that forms on the surface of iron is what we call rust.You may have seen rust on old cars or old iron sheds.
