## Coal extraction
Coal extraction The set of operations leading to the identification of coalfields and to their assessment is called mining prospecting.As with oil,an analysis of airplane pictures is conducted to identify geologically interesting areas,then soil samples are studied to obtain more detailed information.Coalbed methane extractionBasic principles Methane adsorbed into a solid coal matrix (coal macerals) will be released if the coal seam is depressurised.Methane may be extracted by drilling wells into the coal seam.The goal is to decrease the water pressure by pumping water from the well.
