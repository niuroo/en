## Ilmenite: An ore of titanium Uses and Properties
Ilmenite is a black iron titanium oxide with a chemical composition of FeTiO 3.Ilmenite is the primary ore of titanium,a metal needed to make a variety of high performance alloys.Most of the ilmenite mined worldwide is used to manufacture titanium dioxide,TiO 2,…Iron OreIron ore is used directly in the steelmaking process in the blast furnace in the form of lump,pellet,and fines (see Fig.5).(Fines are converted to sinter feed in a sinter plant.) Iron ore pellets are also used in the production of DRI and HBI.

## Are ilmenite and rutile iron ores
Is ilmenite an iron ore? It is a lustrous black to brownish ore (FeTiO3) and is the principal or of titanium.Though as you can see it does have as much Iron in it as titanium.IlmeniteIlmenite by itself is not a profitable iron ore as the titanium inhibits the smelting process.Ilmenite,hematite and corundum all have similar structures and belong to a more or less informal group called the Hematite Group with a general formula of A 2 O 3.

## Ilmenite Ore Price
We believe ilmenite has the strongest near term price growth due to previous closures of mines in China,where ilmenite is produced as a by product of iron ore.Our channel checks suggest that 500kt of ilmenite supply was lost from Sichuan Province in 2015,tightening the Chinese feedstock market.Percentage Of Ilmenite In Iron OreAnd they are mainly used to crush coarse minerals like gold and copper ore,metals like steel and iron,glass,coal,asphalt,gravel,concrete,etc.With more than 2,500 case sites,the scientific management method,the refined manufacturing process,and the innovative manufacturing concept,have rapidly grown into the mining machinery production and export bases in China even the world.
