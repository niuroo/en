## Flux metallurgy Britannica
Flux,in metallurgy,any substance introduced in the smelting of ores to promote fluidity and to remove objectionable impurities in the form of slag.Limestone is commonly used for this purpose in smelting iron ores.Other materials used as fluxes are silica,dolomite,lime,borax,and fluorite.The Extraction of IronMild steel: Mild steel is iron containing up to about 0.25% of carbon.The presence of the carbon makes the steel stronger and harder than pure iron.The higher the percentage of carbon,the harder the steel becomes.Mild steel is used for lots of things nails :
