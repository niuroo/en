## Monitoring of Grain Size and Concentration in Ore Slurries
This grinding process is carried out in multiple steps,and often covers six decimal orders of magnitude of the particle size.For the coarse grinding process,classic crushers are utilized.The primary and secondary grinding is performed in semi autogenous (SAG) or autogenous (AG) mills,and in ball or rod mills.Grinding Kinetics of Slag and Effect of Final Particle.This study aims to model grinding of a Polish ferronickel slag and evaluate the particle size distributions (PSDs) of the products obtained after different grinding times.Then,selected products were alkali activated in order to investigate the effect of particle size on the compressive strength of the produced alkali activated materials (AAMs).
