## What Makes Concrete a Sustainable Building Material?
The predominant raw material for the cement in concrete is limestone,the most abundant mineral on earth.Concrete can also be made with fly ash,slag cement,and silica fume,all waste byproducts from power plants,steel mills,and other manufacturing facilities.Chemical AdmixturesAir entraining chemicals should never be mixed with any other chemical additives.Figure 4.Mode of action of an air entraining agent Just providing an adequate air content inside concrete is not sufficient.Small and stable air bubbles are required

## Cement
Concrete is the most widely used material in existence and is only behind water as the planet's most consumed resource.[1] Cements used in construction are usually inorganic,often lime or calcium silicate based,which can be characterized as non hydraulic or hydraulic respectively,depending on the ability of the cement to set in the presence of water (see hydraulic and non hydraulic lime.Cement AdditiveReduction in power consumption in the grinding process is up to 10% when compared to oil derived additives,while concrete finished structures are more than 10% stronger than identical structures obtained with no added bioglycerol.
