## Types of Concrete
Concrete is a composite consisting of the following main constituents: cement,aggregates,water,and admixtures.It is a material that can be cast into different shapes,is durable,is the most attractive construction material in terms of compressive strength (construction material with highest strength per unit cost),and its increasing use is fundamental for sustainable construction.Specification of historic concreteSpecification of historic concrete The First Edition of Reinforced Concrete Designers’ Handbook (1932) by Reynolds proposes a series of concrete mixes A to F,with proportions ranging from 1:3:6 up to 1:1:2.The corresponding working stresses for the hardened concrete range from 400 psi up to 875 psi (say 2.8 6.0N mm 2),though it is not clear what cube strengths these would equate to.
