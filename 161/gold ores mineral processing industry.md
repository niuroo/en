## Current status and development of primary gold ore.
Gold demand increase over recent years provokes technology advancement of gold ore dressing,especially the remarkable advances made in primary gold ores from both easy to treat ores and refractory ores.The progress goes in the improvement of conventional.Eliminating Copper from Gold OreWhen reviewing Methods of Eliminating Copper from Gold Ores we see that several methods have been suggested to eliminate copper from ores prior to cyanidation.Preliminary extraction of the copper with sulphuric or sulphurous acids may be applicable to ores containing oxidized copper minerals such as malachite,azurite and chrysocolla but these acids have but little effect on sulphide copper.

## Trends in the Crushing of Mineral Ores
&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Crushing is an important step in the complex process of mineral processing (Fig.1).In open pit mines,rock chunks with edge lengths of 2 m have to be processed.In underground mines,the biggest chunk sizes are about 0.5 m.Crushers have the task of reducing the ore rock to particle sizes in the millimetre range for subsequent grinding.Gold processing 101In most cases,gold processing with cyanide leaching,usually with carbon adsorption,is still the core technology and the critical thing is understanding the mineralogy in order to optimise flowsheet selection and cost drivers,and get the best out of the process.is a little more complex for gold ores,as the optimal process flowsheet.
