## Gypsum Powder Production
Natural gypsum generally includes dehydrate gypsum and anhydrous gypsum.In order to get the valuable materials,generally,we get semi hydrated gypsum through heating the dehydrate gypsum.The calcined semi hydrated gypsum can widely be used for plasterboard,decoration board,gypsum block,stucco gypsum,and molding gypsum etc Content of CaSO4&#183;2H2O in gypsum mine &gt; 80%.GypsumThe natural dihydrate gypsum is calcined into semi hydrate gypsum under the temperature of 107 ~ 170 C and then is ground into powder which is the building gypsum.Its reactive mode is: CaSO 4 &#183; 2 H 2 O + → 107 ∼ 170 ∘ C air heating CaSO 4 &#183; 1 2 H 2 O + 1 2 H 2 O
