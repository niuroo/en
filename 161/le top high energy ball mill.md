## Synthesis of Nanomaterials by High Energy Ball Milling
The ball mill system consists of one turn disc (turn table) and two or four bowls.The turn disc rotates in one direction while the bowls rotate in the opposite direction.The centrifugal forces,created by the rotation of the bowl around its own axis together with the rotation of the turn disc,are applied to the powder mixture and milling balls in the bowl.TECHNICAL NOTES 8 GRINDING R.P.Kingmill is the energy consumption.The power supplied to the mill is used primarily to lift the load (medium and charge).Additional power is required to keep the mill rotating.8.1.3 Power drawn by ball,semi autogenous and autogenous mills A simplified picture of
