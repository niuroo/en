This concrete grade strength class is largely recommended in the design of reinforced concrete columns,beams,and slabs for use under mild exposure condition (Mosley et al.2007).Screed Concrete Structural GuideGrade of the screed concrete could be C15 or C20 mainly Further,if no screed is laid,water in the concrete will absorbed by soil before it gets harden This will create honeycombs or dry surfaces with more porosity that could allow water to penetrate up to the reinforcement As a result,reinforcement may corrode with time
