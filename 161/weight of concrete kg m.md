Types,Uses and AdvantagesThe density (unit weight) of such concrete (determined in the dry state) should not exceed 1840 kg m&#179; (115 lb ft&#179;),and is usually between 14 kg m&#179; (85 and 110 lb ft&#179;).On the other hand,masonry concrete generally has a density between 500 and 800 kg m&#179; (30 and 50 lb ft&#179;) and a strength between 7 and 14 MPa (10 psi).

## Density Of Concrete
A normal weight concrete weighs 2400 kg per cubic meter or 145 lbs per cubic foot (3915 lbs per cubic yard).The unit weight of concrete (density) varies depending on the amount and density of the aggregate,the amount of entrained air (and entrapped air),and the water and cement content.What is the unit weight of concreteOne cubic foot of concrete weighs about 144.05 lbs,so one cubic meter of concrete equals 2307.46 kg m^3 or 5087.08 lb m^3.This can vary depending on strength,additives,and other factors.
