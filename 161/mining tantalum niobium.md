Tantalum is an important component in many modern technologies,and is used in capacitors for everything from computers to mobile phones.Despite its importance in the world today,tantalum mining.Mining TechnologyTantalite contains some niobium,with the mineral being referred to as niobite or columbite when the niobium content is greater than that of tantalum.Indeed,until the discovery of the world’s pyrochlore deposits in the 1950s,niobium was a by product of tantalum mining,with increasing demand ensuring that it was highly valued and highly priced.

## The World's Largest Producers of Niobium
Initially,mining was done through the open stoping underground method,however,the block caving mining method will soon be introduced.Nigeria has been producing niobium for a long time.In fact,before the discovery of pyrochlore in Brazil,Nigeria was a major producer of niobium.TantalumHistory Tantalum was discovered in Sweden in 1802 by Anders Ekeberg,in two mineral samples one from Sweden and the other from Finland.One year earlier,Charles Hatchett had discovered columbium (now niobium),and in 1809 the English chemist William Hyde Wollaston compared its oxide,columbite with a density of 5.918 g cm 3,to that of tantalum,tantalite with a density of 7.935 g cm 3.
