## Crushing Concrete Cube or Cylinder at 28 days
The crushing of concrete cubes or cylinder samples is required in a construction especially concrete structures.The reason why this is to verify the strength given in the design mix.Let say for example for a concrete column commonly it has 60 megapascals of specified strength.When you crush it,the result should be equal or more than 60 Mpa.The specified strength should be achieved at 28.Concrete Testing Equipment MatestConcrete is one of the most used materials in the construction industry.Several variables contribute to define the quality of the concrete utilized for a structure: workability,consistency,setting time and air content are only few examples.Matest proposes a wide.
