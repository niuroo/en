## Grinding Circuit
The circuit comprises a SAG mill,12 m diameter by 6.1 m length (belly inside liners,the effective grinding volume),two pebble crushers,and two ball mills in parallel closed with cyclones.The SAG mill is fitted with a 20 MW gearless drive motor with bi directional rotational capacity.ball milling machine energy balanceThe High Energy Ball Mill E max and MM 500 were developed for grinding with the highest energy input.The innovative design of both,the mills and the grinding jars,allows for continuous grinding down to the nano range in the shortest amount of time with only minor warming effects.

## Cement mill
The grinding action employs much greater stress on the material than in a ball mill,and is therefore more efficient.Energy consumption is typically half that of a ball mill.However,the narrowness of the particle size distribution of the cement is problematic,and the process has yet to receive wide acceptance.High pressure roll presses
