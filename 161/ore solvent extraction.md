## GROWING ROLE OF SOLVENT EXTRACTION IN,
Growing role of solvent extraction in copper ores processing 31 • solvent extraction,in which the aqueous pregnant leach solution (PLS) is vigHow can mining become more environmentally sustainable?For instance,the development of technologies including froth floatation for processing certain metal sulphide ores,the Solvent Extraction Electrowinning process for obtaining copper,and the use of cyanide in gold extraction have all made previously uneconomic grades of ore suitable for mining,thus increasing economically viable mineral.

## Copper recovery using leach solvent extraction,
Copper recovery using leach solvent extraction electrowinning technology 65 (Figure 2) and a catalytic amount of LIX 63,was introduced in 19657 and in March 1968 the first commercial copper L SX EW operation,the Bluebird plan of RanchersMining and Extraction: Oxide Ores processes forSolvent Extraction and Electrowinning (SXEW) production,virtually nonexistent before the 1960s,reached nearly 3.8 million tonnes of copper in 2013.(Courtesy of ICSG.) One of the biggest advantages of using leaching is that low grade ores that would be uneconomic to smelt become economic to leach.

## Uranium processing Britannica
Uranium processing,preparation of the ore for use in various products Uranium ores occur in deposits that are both near surface and very deep (eg,300 to 1,200 metres,or 1,000 to 4,000 feet) The deep ores sometimes occur in seams as thick as 30 metr As is the case with ores of other metals.Uranium Extraction Process Mineral Processing &,Ore lots,concentrate lots,solvent extraction and carbonate pregnant liquors assays are all run by chloroform extraction balance method Low grade solution assays up to 1 g per liter uranium for mill control are run by fluorimeter,
