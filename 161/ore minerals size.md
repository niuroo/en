## Ore Minerals : What are Ore Minerals? Geology Page
An ore is a natural occurrence of rock or sediment which contains enough minerals with economically important elements,typically metals,that can be extracted from the deposit economically.The ores are extracted by mining for a profit from the earth; they are then refined (often by smelting) in order to extract the valuable elements.ORE MINERALS SPECIMENS BIG SIZE ORES MINERALS …ORE MINERALS SPECIMENS BIG SIZE ORES MINERALS STONES ROCKSMINS,AMIT INTERNATIONAL ROCKSMINS AMBALA CANTT,ORE MINERALS : Asbestos (Mg),Bauxite (Al),Beryl (Be),Borax (Na),Calcite (Ca),Chalcocite (Cu),Chalcopyrite (Cu.

## Ore Deposits
An ore is a rock that contains important minerals.An ore deposit must be profitable to mine.If it is no longer profitable,it is no longer an ore deposit.Geologists find ore deposits by testing the chemistry of the rock and soil.They can also determine the size ofMinerals Free Full Text Grain Size Distribution and Clay …The results showed that the grain size and volume curve of rare earth ore have unimodal and bimodal shapes,respectively.X ray diffraction showed the differences in clay mineral types formed by different weathered bedrocks.The principal clay minerals were with.
