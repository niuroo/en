## Crusher Reduction Ratio
Crusher Reduction Ratio I have mentioned the fact that,as the % of voids in the crushing chamber decreases,the production of fines by attrition increases.This is like saying that,as the Crusher Reduction Ratio in any given crusher is increased,the % of fines in the product will increase,even though theEquipment Sizing: Crusher or Grinding MillThe 80% passing size in microns is a convenient term for expressing the fineness of a crushed or ground product.It is also a convenient base for calculating the reduction ratio and the work required for reduction.It is readily found by plotting the percent passing on log log paper,

## Tips to maximize crushing efficiency
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Efficiency can be defined by the ratio of a machine’s work to the energy supplied to the machine.To apply what this means to your crusher,operations produce the exact sizes in the reduction process that their market demands.In the past,quarries produced a range of singlCrusherA crusher is a machine designed to reduce large rocks into smaller rocks,gravel,or rock dust.Crushers may be used to reduce the size,or change the form,of waste materials so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled,or to reduce the size of a solid mix of raw materials (as in rock ore),so that pieces of different composition can be differentiated.
