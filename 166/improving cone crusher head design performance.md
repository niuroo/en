## HP Cone Crusher Types of Cone Crusher
Cone crusher is an important part of crushing circuit which including rock crusher,material feeder,vibrating screen,convey belt.The determination of cone crusher is very key to the performance of the crushing plant.As the following factors will improve crushing capability and efficiency should be taken into consideration.Cone CrusherThe cone crusher is therefore an excellent arrested crusher.The flare of the bowl allows a much greater head angle than in the gyratory crusher,while retaining the same angle between the crushing members.This gives the cone crusher a high capacity,since the capacity of gyratory crushers is roughly proportional to the diameter of the head.

A crusher is a machine designed to reduce large rocks into smaller rocks,gravel,or rock dust.Crushers may be used to reduce the size,or change the form,of waste materials so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled,or to reduce the size of a solid mix of raw materials (as in rock ore),so that pieces of different composition can be differentiated.Cone CrushersCone crushers are used in AG and SAG grinding circuits to increase tonnage by effectively dealing with any pebble (critical size) build up problem.Normally,heavy duty short head crushers are employed to crush pebbles.Power and crusher cavity level are the key variables for monitoring and control
