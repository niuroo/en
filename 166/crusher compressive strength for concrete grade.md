The mean flexural strength of concrete has been considered from four consecutive test results exceeds the specified characteristic strength by at least 0.3 N Sqmm.The determined flexural strength is should not be less than the compressive strength less 0.3 N Sqmm.We hope,you may well understand the Acceptance criteria concrete cube test results.compressive strength values of m30 concretecompressive strength test,split tensile strength,flexural strength,and permeability tests are presented in this paper.proportions recycled aggregate concrete of grade M20,M30.s

## Compressive strength
Compressive Strength of Concrete.For designers,compressive strength is one of the most important engineering properties of concrete.It is a standard industrial practice that the concrete is classified based on grades.This grade is nothing but the Compressive Strength of the concrete cube or â€¦Strength of Recycled Concrete Made From Crushed Concrete.Compressive strength of hardened concretes made from recycled concrete coarse aggregates was studied as a function Of the compressive strength of original concretes from which the coarse aggregates were derived Also studied were properties of fresh concretes made from recycled aggregates,gradings of crusher products,properties of recycled.
