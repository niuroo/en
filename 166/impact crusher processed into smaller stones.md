## Impact Crusher Working Principle
Starting from the base working principle that compression is the forcing of two surfaces towards one another to crush the material caught between them.Impact crushing can be of two variations: gravity and dynamic.An example of gravity impact would be dropping a rock onto a steel plate (similar to what goes on into an Autogenous Mill).Mini Crusher,Small Jaw Crusher,Mini Concrete Crusher.Small jaw crusher: small jaw crusher or mini jaw crusher is the most common type,it can be used to crush a variety of hard ores and other solid bulk materials.Small roller Crusher: the small stone crusher is good tertiary crusher,and its finished products are in regular shape,but its compressive strength canâ€™t exceed 60MPa.
