## Crusher
A gyratory crusher is similar in basic concept to a jaw crusher,consisting of a concave surface and a conical head; both surfaces are typically lined with manganese steel surfaces.The inner cone has a slight circular movement,but does not rotate; the movement is generated by an eccentric arrangement.As with the jaw crusher,CrushersThus,crusher jaws are made of highly wear resistant austenitic manganese steel casting,which combines both high toughness and good resistance to wear.Austenitic manganese steel was invented by Sir Robert Hadfield in 1882 and was first granted patented in Britain in 1883 with patent number 200.
