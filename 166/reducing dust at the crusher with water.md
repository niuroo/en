## Use of Air and Water Spraying Systems for Improving Dust.
The spraying systems form an integral part of longwall shearers,and their function is to reduce airborne dust levels and to prevent methane explosion.The use of air and water spraying systems can reduce dust concentration by up to 80% and they contribute to a significant reduction of dust concentration in the air.Do you know the best practices for dust control?&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;From a processing standpoint,considerations for dust control should include covers on conveyors,at transfer points,and at the screen discharge,as well as hooded and sealed areas at crusher discharge points to allow spraying of water,making sure to maintain the skirting with tight seals.
