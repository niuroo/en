As the Crusher Concave Liners and Mantle Wear out there is a period when the crusher won’t be as efficient as it could be.This can be a very frustrating period for the operators.Since the throughput drops and operators have to work harder,usually doing the same thing over and over again.Unfortunately to get the most from the equipment requires that there is one hundred percent wear on.Gyratory Crusher &amp; Cone Crusher Mantle DifferencesThe greater angle of the cone crusher puts the pivot point below the distributor plate.While the pivot point for the gyratory crusher is at the spider cap.This difference in the pattern of gyration has a purpose.The primary crusher produces a product that is gauged by the size of the open side of the mantle.
