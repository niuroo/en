How Does A Cone Crusher Work？ Cone Crusher Working Principle is following: Ore moving cone (broken wall) away from the fixed cone lining (rolling acetabular wall) side of the moment,fall into the crushing chamber,moving toward the fixed cone when the cone liner to return to complete the first ore crushing.Talc powder hydraulic cone stone brokencone crusher equipment application in the mudstone.Cone crusher has many advantages,such as large broken ratio,high efficiency,low energy consumption and product granularity.It is suitable for the second broken or fine broken of various kinds of ores and rocks.In the mudstone processing plant,cone crusher is the main mining machines.

## Impact Crusher
Cone crushers tend to produce more elongated particles because of their ability to pass through the chamber unbroken.In an impact crusher,all particles are subjected to impact and the elongated particles,having a lower strength due to their thinner cross section,would be broken (Ramos et al.1994; Kojovic and Bearman,1997).6.5.1 Hammer MillsThe Difference Between Impact Crusher And Cone CrusherAs we all know,in the stone production line,the broken processing stone is generally completed by a combination of rough and fine breaking.In the process of rough breaking,users often choose the jaw crusher,but many users will be entangled in the process of fine crushing.Which one is the impact crusher and the cone crusher?After repeated discretion,it is still difficult to decide.
