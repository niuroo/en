All the sand particles should have higher crushing strength.The ratio of fines below 600 microns in sand should not be less than 30%.In manufactured sand the permissible limit of fines below 75 microns shall not exceed 15%.CrushingCone CrusherThese crushers are designed so that the head to depth ratio is larger than the standard gyratory crusher and the cone angles are much flatter and the slope of the mantle and the concaves are parallel to each other.The flatter cone angles help to retain the particles longer between the crushing surfaces and therefore produce much finer particles.
