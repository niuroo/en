## Mill (grinding)
A VSI mill throws rock or ore particles against a wear plate by slinging them from a spinning center that rotates on a vertical shaft.This type of mill uses the same principle as a VSI crusher.Tower mill.Tower mills,often called vertical mills,stirred mills or regrind mills,are a more efficient means of grinding material at smaller particle sizes,and can be used after ball …modelling,simulation and optimisation of a crushing plantthe Mowana crushing circuit is carried out by combining the steady state and dynamic broad knowledge of control principles and a well designed schema are.

## Cone Crushers Working Principle
Cone Crushers Working Principle.When Cone crusher is working,the motor drives the eccentric bush via bevel &amp; pinion gear.Mantle core is forced to swing by the eccentric bush,which makes the mantle sometimes close to the concave,and sometimes far away from concave.CrushersThe disadvantage of this type of crusher,when high capacity is required,is the relatively small discharge width,limiting the capacity as compared with the discharge circuit of a gyratory crusher.Jaw crushers are mainly used in plants producing up to approximately 1600 t h.Primary crushing with gyratory crushers
