## Crusher
Each crusher is designed to work with a certain maximum size of raw material,and often delivers its output to a screening machine which sorts and directs the product for further processing.Typically,crushing stages are followed by milling stages if the materials need to be further reduced.Design and Fabrication of Can CrusherThere are so many researchers who have done work on design and analysis,but still there are so many areas of scope regarding this design and analysis.This project involves processes like design,fabrication and assembling procedures.Even though there are many types of the can crusher machine in the market,the completion of the new model.
