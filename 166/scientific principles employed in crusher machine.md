## Impact Crusher
A jaw crusher crushes only a small proportion of the original aggregate particles but an impact crusher crushes mortar and aggregate particles alike and thus generates a higher amount of fine material (O’Mahony,1990).Gyratory crushers work on the same principle as cone crushers (Figure 4.4(c)).These have a gyratory motion driven by an.Mechanical screeningMechanical screening,often just called screening,is the practice of taking granulated ore material and separating it into multiple grades by particle size.This practice occurs in a variety of industries such as mining and mineral processing,agriculture,pharmaceutical,food,plastics,and recycling.[A method of separating solid particles according to size alone is called screening]
