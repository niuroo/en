## Secondary Crushing Equipment
The term “secondary crushing” has become well established and familiar through long usage; it applies to the crushing stage,either single or multiple,which follows immediately after the primary crusher,taking all or a portion of the product of the primary crushing stage as its feed.The term should not be used,as it sometimes is,to designate a particular type or size of crusher.Crusher Product Gradation ChartsCrusher manufacturers publish grid charts,particle size cumulative distribution curves,and or product size distribution tables to help predict the gradation of the crusher product.These charts,curves,and tables give the percentages passing or retained on standard size screens for each given setting of the crusher.
