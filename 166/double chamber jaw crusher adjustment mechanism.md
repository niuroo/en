## Optimization Design for Crushing Mechanism of Double.
This paper conducts a comprehensive study on the optimization design for crushing mechanism of double toggle jaw crusher.The optimization aim is to reduce characteristic value of moving jaw plate,to raise capacity of jaw crusher,and to ensure entrance and outlet dimensions of jaw crusher.Firstly,formulae are derived for disRange,Working Principle,ApplicationThe rock is dropped between two rigid pieces of metal,one of which then Deep chambered jaw crushers will have more rock on rock crushing while the Double Toggle jaw crushers may feature hydraulic toggle adjusting mechanisms.

## Jaw Crushers Jaw Crusher Hard Rock Processing Materials
The single toggle crusher is designed for a high capacity throughput due to the elliptical movement of the swing jaw which also assists in the discharge of the crushed material As the single toggle crusher will achieve far higher capacities than the double toggle design they are often used as a primary crusherJaw Crushers McLanahanOn the overhead eccentric style Jaw Crusher the moving swing jaw is suspended on the eccentric shaft with heavy duty double roll spherical roller bearings The swing jaw undergoes two types of motion one is a swing motion toward the opposite chamber side called a stationary jaw die due to the action of a toggle plate and the second is a vertical movement due to the rotation of the eccentric

## Types of Crushers
Crushers may be divided into three general classes,with respect to the manner in which they do their work: Pressure Crushers: This category embraces the several types of gyratory crushers and jaw crushers,as well as the double crushing rolls,with either smooth or corrugated shells.Impact Crushers: This division is represented chiefly by the various styles of hammermill; also by the cage.
