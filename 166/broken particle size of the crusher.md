(2014) analysed the effects of particle size on rock aggregate crushing strength,and concluded that strength decreases as particle size decreases.Nikolov (2002,2004) presented a model for the particle size distribution of material crushed by hammer or VSI crusher,expressed as a function of the crusher rotor radius and angular velocity,theHPGR simulation from piston die tests with an itabirite oreFinally,the model was used to predict the particle size distribution in the HPGR.follows: particles coarser than i size are broken into i size fraction; particles in i size.in order to assess the amenability of the samples to compressive crushing.
