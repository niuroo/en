## Coarse Fly Ash
Milling or grinding can reduce coarse fly ash particles to fine particle size in a similar Milling breaks solid materials into smaller pieces by grinding,crushing,Three types of millings have been used to grind fly ash to smaller particle size:An Experimental Study on High Performance Concrete Using.the concrete mix.In this study two types,SCC mixes were prepared namely,Conventional SCC in which cement content was replaced by 30% with fly ash and Triple blended SCC in which cement content was reduced to 50% &amp; the rest of the cement content was replaced with fly ash &amp; GGBS by 25% each.
