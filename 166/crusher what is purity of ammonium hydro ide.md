## Anhydrous Ammonia: Uses &amp; Safety
The massive amounts of anhydrous ammonia that are stored in the fertilizer industry require a few extra levels of caution and safety.In fact,some of the worst industrial explosions have occurred.Ammonia RefrigerationAmmonia is a chemical consisting of one atom of nitrogen and three atoms of hydrogen.It is designated in chemical notation as NH3.Ammonia is extremely soluble in water and is frequently used as a water solution called aqua ammonia.Ammonia chemically combines with water to form ammonium hydroxide.

## Aqua Ammonia: Specifications
Aqua Ammonia (Ammonium Hydroxide) is a water solution of ammonia,and assay is determined by weight of ammonia in water.Each batch is tested for strength,color,and clarity.Trace element analysis are performed every 6 months by an independent lab,and are available for review.AmmoniaHousehold ammonia or ammonium hydroxide is a solution of NH 3 in water.The concentration of such solutions is measured in units of the Baum&#233; scale,with 26 degrees Baum&#233; (about 30% (by weight) ammonia at 15.5 &#176;C or 59.9 &#176;F) being the typical high concentratio

## Ammonia (NH3) (nh3)
Pure ammonia was first pre pared by Joseph Priestley in 1774,and its exact composition was determined by Claude Louis Berthollet in 1785.Ammonia is highly soluble in water,forming an alkaline solution called ammonium hydroxide.Moreover,it becomes highly reactive when dissolved in water and readDilution Calculations for Aqua AmmoniaDilution Calculations for Aqua Ammonia Calculating the amount of ammonia or water to make a specific concentration of aqua ammonia does not follow normal dilution rules.The anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia volumes are not additive with water volumes,i.e.one gallon of
