## Effect of Feed Rock Size Distribution on Crusher Performance
If the ore feed to any gyratory or jaw crusher consisted entirely of large cubes or spheres of a size that would just barely enter the crushing chamber,the crusher could not be expected to produce anything like its normal rated capacity because the upper part of the crusher could not shattEffect of Size and Gradation of Crusher Stone and Crusher.Fig1 (b): Grain size distribution curve From the test results of crusher dust,the following identifications are made.The grain size distribution of crusher dust shows that it consists of 92% of sand size and 4% of silt size particles.It is equally dominated by particles of coarse,medium and fine sand sizes
