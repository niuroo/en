A simple rule for troubleshooting bearing temperatures: No more than 180 degrees Fahrenheit (82 degrees Celsius) on the housing.The bearing outer ring can be up to 20&#176;F (11&#176;C) hotter than the housing.The lubricant originally specified for the application was likely selected to run at lower.Cone Crusher Maintenance&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;The maximum oil temperature is controlled by a sensor switch at the reservoir return line.If your crusher is being used regularly in extreme heat (plus 100 degrees F) or cold temperatures (minus 10 degrees F) and it is hard to maintain crusher oil in the correct operating range,it may be helpful to switch to synthetic oil.4.
