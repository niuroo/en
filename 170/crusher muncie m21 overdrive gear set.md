The Doug Nash Muncie 4 speed case and gearset was produced in the late 1960's to early 1970's.The pictures show that yes Muncie cast iron cases did exist.The problem with the case is that although it was heavy and indeed made of nodular iron the reverse idler boss would break under load.The gear set Nash sold was based on a 12 lug &quot;pro.Muncie M21 with overdrive gears NastyZ28.com&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Basically what I have heard is that this combo is out there,but is not very useful.THe reason is that 4th gear on a Muncie style trans locks the input and output shafts together.Therefore without a total redesign 4th gear cannot be overdrive.They make 3rd gear the overdrive gear to get around this,and thus the shift pattern is all screwed up.
