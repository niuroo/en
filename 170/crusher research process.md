## Comminution
Comminution is the reduction of solid materials from one average particle size to a smaller average particle size,by crushing,grinding,cutting,vibrating,or other processes.In geology,it occurs naturally during faulting in the upper part of the Earth's crust.In industry,it is an important unit operation in mineral processing,ceramics,electronics,and other fielResearch on Wetting Process in the Flotation OperationResearch on the flotation process flow has never been ceased especially on the wetting process in flotation machine operation Broadly speaking after any fluid and solid or liquid contact the immersion phenomenon after adherence and spread can be called wetting process
