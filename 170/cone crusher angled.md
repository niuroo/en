## Tips to maximize crushing efficiency
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;The closed side setting of a jaw crusher helps determine the nip angle within a chamber,typically 19 to 23 degrees.Too large of an angle causes boiling in the crushing chamber.This is where the jaw plates cannot grip onto the rock,and it keeps slipping up and down,avoiding being crushed.ThCrusher Concave Liners and Mantle WearAs the Crusher Concave Liners and Mantle Wear out there is a period when the crusher won’t be as efficient as it could be.This can be a very frustrating period for the operators.Since the throughput drops and operators have to work harder,usually doing the same thing over and over again.Unfortunately to get the most from the equipment req
