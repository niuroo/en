## Impact Crusher Working Principle
Starting from the base working principle that compression is the forcing of two surfaces towards one another to crush the material caught between them Impact crushing can be of two variations gravity and dynamic An example of gravity impact would be dropping a rock onto a steel plate similar to what goes on into an Autogenous Mill Dynamic impact could be described as material droppingVertical Shaft Impact Crusher China First Engineering.Vertical Shaft Impact Crusher Overview: Vertical shaft impact crusher is widely used in crushing and reshaping of rock and artificial sand making.It is suitable for crushing of fragile materials below level 9 of Moh’s hardness rather than viscous materials or stone materials containing much solid.

## Vertical Shaft Impact Crusher
Abstract: The rotor of vertical shaft impact crusher was modeled by SolidWorks and imported into EDEM for dynamic simulation.The average speed,maximum speed,average force,maximum force with time were analyzed in rotor,so the true law of particles motion in rotor would be revealed,indicated that the speed of particle field in rotor increased with theVSI Vertical Shaft Impact CrushersCONSTMACH Vertical Shaft Impact Crushers are known as also SAND MAKING MACHINES and used as a tertiary stage crusher to get high ratio of fine material and to give cubical shape to the products that are coming through the secondary crushers.Any type of materials,especially the hard stones such as basalt and granite with maximum 45 mm size
