## Understanding influence of crushers on shape
nbsp 0183 32 Shape characteristics of fine aggregates namely angularity and form 2D are greatly associated with the types of rocks mineralogical compositions and allied crushing mechanism Thus for a given source and aggregate the type of crusher may play a critical roleCrushing 101 MasabaThusly,the circuit capacity is increased and the load on the crushing equipment downstream is minimized.Hsi crushers can produce and excess of fines in soft material,they can be dusty during operation.Hsi crushers are very popular in recycle applications as the can be run by themselves with no secondary crushers.
