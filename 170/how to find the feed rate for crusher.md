## Crusher
A crusher is a machine designed to reduce large rocks into smaller rocks,gravel,or rock dust.Crushers may be used to reduce the size,or change the form,of waste materials so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled,or to reduce the size of a solid mix of raw materials (as in rock ore),so that pieces of different composition cUnit 2: Speed and Feed Manufacturing Processes 4 52.Feed rate is defined as tool’s distance travelled during one spindle revolution.3.Feed rate and cutting speed determine the rate of material removal,power requirements,and surface finish.4.Feed rate and cutting speed are mostly determined by the material that’s being cut.
