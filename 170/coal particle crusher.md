## Crusher
A crusher is a machine designed to reduce large rocks into smaller rocks,gravel,or rock dust.Crushers may be used to reduce the size,or change the form,of waste materials so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled,or to reduce the size of a solid mix of raw materials (as in rock ore),so that pieces of different composition cJaw CrusherSrikanth [7] used a jaw crusher to create −37 μm coal dust particles.Coal samples were obtained from coal mines in addition to some samples from the same source as Thakur's samples.They used a Microtrac Standard Range Analyzer (SRA) and Small Particle Analyser (SPA),which measured projected area (and hence diameter) using laser scattering.

Again,coal washing equipment requirements are different on the coal particle.Therefore,the coal roll crusher equipment selected should also have some differences in coal production.If the washing particle size exceeds the limit of coal washing equipment.It will cause pipeline blockage,pump blockage and so on.PulverizerDepending on the required coal fineness,there are two types of classifier that may be selected for a vertical roller mill.The dynamic classifier,which consists of a stationary angled inlet vane assembly surrounding a rotating vane assembly or cage,is capable of producing micrometer fine pulverized coal with a
