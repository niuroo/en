## Hartl Crusher
QUATTRO MOVEMENT &amp; REVERSE CRUSHING FUNCTION.The unique up thrust position of the toggle plate creates the QUATTRO jaw movement that HARTL is famous for.This special geometry means that the swing jaw does not have an action like conventional crushers that is parallel to the material flow direction but rather a highly effective figure 8 motion.Cone Crushers2020 2 22&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Cone crushers are used in AG and SAG grinding circuits to increase tonnage by effectively dealing with any pebble (critical size) build up problem.Normally,heavy duty short head crushers are employed to crush pebbles.Power and crusher cavity level are the key variables for monitoring and controlling the crusher operation.
