## Four bar linkage
A four bar linkage,also called a four bar,is the simplest movable closed chain linkage.It consists of four bodies,called bars or links,connected in a loop by four joints.Generally,the joints are configured so the links move in parallel planes,and the assembly is called a planar four bar linkage.Spherical and spatial four bar linkages also exist and are used in practice.Four Bar Linkage Analysis4 be the sequence of four joints in a four bar linkage beginning and ending with the joints j 1 and j 4 connected to the ground frame,one of which is connected to the input and the other to the output.For example,the RRRR is the four bar quadrilateral,the RRRP is the slider crank linkage,and the PRRP is called a double slider linkage.

## Simultaneous Minimization of Shaking Moment,Driving.
mechanism member between specified positions such that some quality of dynamic performance is optimized.Conte et al.(1975) synthesized the crank rocker path generating mechanisms with prescribed timing by optimization based on minimizing shaking force,shakingImpact Crusher Working PrincipleStarting from the base working principle that compression is the forcing of two surfaces towards one another to crush the material caught between them.Impact crushing can be of two variations: gravity and dynamic.An example of gravity impact would be dropping a rock onto a steel plate (similar to what goes on into an Autogenous Mill).
