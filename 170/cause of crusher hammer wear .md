## Impact Crusher Working Principle
Starting from the base working principle that compression is the forcing of two surfaces towards one another to crush the material caught between them.Impact crushing can be of two variations: gravity and dynamic.An example of gravity impact would be dropping a rock onto a steel plate (similar to what goes on into an Autogenous Mill).Hammer premature wear in mineral crushing process.Indeed,various crusher components suffer from wear damage in hammers in the hammer mill type,or ball in the ball mill type.In spite of the wear severity of these components in industry,only few research works hav
