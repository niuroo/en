## Jaw Crusher Working Principle
A sectional view of the single toggle type of jaw crusher is shown below.In one respect,the working principle and application of this machine is similar to the Dodge crushers; the movable jaw has its maximum movement at the top of the crushing chamber,and minimum movement at the discharge point.The motion is,however,a more complex one than the DoMobile Impact Crushers,QI Mobile Impact Crusher Series.Sandvik mobile impact crushers: flexible control.This unique concept,available exclusively on Sandvik impactors,enables a single unit to operate in either primary or secondary mode,depending on your needs.To maximize productivity and efficiency,all our impact crushers have features that optimize throughput and minimize spillage.
