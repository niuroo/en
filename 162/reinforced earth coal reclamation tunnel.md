## RESEARCH ON FAILURE MODE OF ROAD EMBANKMENT IN …
To study the seismic design of subgrade engineering,subgrade seismic damage of Wenchuan Ms8.0 earthquake was investigated.It was found that most of the un reinforced embankment suffered from shallow collapse of slope,of which a few were damaged by the.Study of Tunnel Damage Caused by Underground Mining …Bayueshan tunnel (BYS) is an important construction crossing over coal mine goaf.The underground mining subsidence has led the tunnel cracked seriously in three years after it was built.In order to evaluate the coal mine influence and future stability of the tunnels,probability integral method (PIM) was used to calculate the tunnel deformation.PIM is an experience function method based on.

## Mineland Reclamation
Earth Conservancy: Addressing the Past,Reclaiming the Future Since purchasing the Blue Coal lands in 1994,Earth Conservancy has reclaimed 2,000 of its 16,300 acres.Reclamation is expensive,however: over $49.1 million has been invested to date.Reclaim Tunnels and Haul Road OverpassesTechSpan&#174; is the leading precast tunnel system in the mining industry today.Capable of carrying extreme loads from the highest mineral stockpiles and heaviest mine plant,TechSpan&#174; is the ideal solution for reclaim tunnels,conveyor or rail tunnels under haul roads,drive tunnels,portals and many other applications where clearance is needed under a trafficable route or facility.
