## Recovery of zinc from a low grade zinc oxide ore with high …
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Abstract A low grade zinc oxide ore with high silicon was cured by sulfuric acid in a water starved system and then leached in water.Thermodynamics of the curing process was analyzed according to the phase stability diagram for the systems of Zn S O H and Si O H.It was indicated that the extraction of zinc and the dissolution of silica were influenced by the water content in samples during.MAGNESITE ORE DISSOLUTION WITH ORGANIC ACID …Abali et al.[6] used inorganic acid (sulfuric acid) for the dissolution of magnesite and showed that the rate determining step is a chemically controlled.On account of certain limitations of inorganic acids (difficulty in achieving pH control of the reaction medium,poor selectivity and high rates of corrosion of the reaction vessels) organic acids can be considered as active leaching agents.
