## How can we calculate the concentration of nanoparticles …
I think it is hard,maybe impossible,to calculate the concentration of your doped nanoparticles by Mr.Sajita's method.you can use Beer's law,which is A=E x I x C.you can prepare diluted.Molar concentrationMolar concentration (also called molarity,amount concentration or substance concentration) is a measure of the concentration of a chemical species,in particular of a solute in a solution,in terms of amount of substance per unit volume of solution.In chemistry,the most commonly used unit for molarity is the number of moles per litre,having the unit symbol mol L or mol⋅dm −3 in SI unit.

## Concentration
Often in informal,non technical language,concentration is described in a qualitative way,through the use of adjectives such as &quot;dilute&quot; for solutions of relatively low concentration and &quot;concentrated&quot; for solutions of relatively high concentration.To concentrate a solution,one must add more solute (for example,alcohol),or reduce the amount of solvent (for example,water).por le gold concentration unitsTable listing criteria for chemical concentration goals to protect,(&quot;Gold Book&quot;) for,the pH should not be changed more than 02 units from the naturally.Know More Chemical Kinetics

## Concentration Definition (Chemistry)
In chemistry,concentration refers to the amount of a substance in a defined space.Another definition is that concentration is the ratio of solute in a solution to either solvent or total solution.Some units may be converted from one to another.However,it's not always.How Much Gold Is in the Ocean?Gold exists in seawater,but at very dilute concentrations estimated,in more recent times,to be on the order of parts per trillion.Because this concentration is so low,it is difficult to pinpoint exactly how much gold is in the ocean.

## NanoHybrids
In the case of homogenous colloidal solutions (such as Gold Nanoparticles),the optical density is a function of the solution’s concentration.Therefore,optical density can also be expressed as: [the molar absorbance coefficient (the absorbance of the solution per unit length per mole of solute) x the molar concentration of the solution x the pathlength of the light (typically 1 cm)].The process design of gold leaching and carbon in pulp circuitsThe process design of gold leaching and carbon in pulp circuits contaminants.These are removed by thermal regeneration of the eluted carbon,typically in a rotary kiln at temperatures of 650 750 C.Regeneration is carried out in a steam atmosphere to minimize
