Crushed aggregate is produced by crushing quarry rock,boulders,cobbles,or large size gravel.Recycled concrete is a viable source of aggregate and has been satisfactorily used in granular subbases,soil cement,and in new concrete.After harvesting,aggregate is processed: crushed,screened,and washed to obtain proper cleanliness and gradation.Properties of Different Grades of Concrete Using Mix,Abstract: The aim of this study is to investigate the characteristics exhibited by three different grades of concrete using mix design approach From the result of the sieve analysis,it shows that the sands used for the experiment is a well graded sand of zone 1 of BS882 parts 2 (1973)
