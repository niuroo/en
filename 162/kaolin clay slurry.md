What is the Difference Between Kaolin and Bentonite Clay? Kaolin is a clay that is rich with kaolinite mineral.Bentonite is a form of mineral which mainly consists of montmorillonite.They have different chemical formulas; The general chemical formula of kaolin is Al 2 Si 2 O 5 (OH) 4 while the general chemical formula of bentonite varies with the dominant chemical element present in the clay.RELATION OF VISCOSITY OF KAOLIN WATER SUSPENSIONS TO MONTMORILLONITE CONTENT OF CERTAIN GEORGIA CLAYS byJ.M.Huber Corporation,Clay Division,Huber,Georgia ABSTRACT THE viscosity of certain kaolin water systems was correlated with natural montmorfllo nite content of the kaolin,as determined quantitatively by the Hinckley Bates (1960)

## Fluid Behaviors of Kaolin Slurry
Kaolin slurry was prepared by mixing kaolin clay (Suzhou kaolin clay) and water.In slurry,pH was controlled by adding acid and base.There were different kinds of dispersants including anionic organic dispersants (e.g.PN),cationic organic dispersants (e.g.BO) and non ionic organic dispersants (e.g.VD).The rheology was measured by Rotovisco RV20 made by HAAK corp.&gt;3 Results and DiscussionKaolin SlurryKaolin water slurry is a viscoplastic fluid with a yield stress arising from particle interactions within the suspension.It is often described as a Bingham fluid yet its rheology can be more accurately described by a Herschel Bulkley model (Figure 1),as it shows a non linear dependence on strain rate (Hulme,1974; Huang and Garcia,1998; Balmforth et al.2000).

Slurry is simply the water and dispersed clay mixture,which puts the clay particles in suspension.De gritting The slurried kaolin is usually transported through pipelines to degritting facilities,where sand,mica and other impurities are extracted with the help of gravity.What is a Clay Slurry? EnviromedicaCLAY SLURRY: In definition,clay slurries are an alternate method of preparing a traditional Magnetic Clay Bath.” Slurries are somewhat of a cross between a thin clay pack and a traditional clay bath,but provide a different detoxification effect than either of these two.

It was found that the best results of the stabilization of the kaolin slurry can be obtained while using sodium water glass of silicate moduli 2 2.5.Sodium water glasses of the moduli smaller than 2 precipitated free silica in the suspension and increased the alkalinity of ceramic slurry while those larger than 2.5 created independent silicate micelles,co existing with the dispersed kaolin.Kaolin ClayKaolin clay hardly dissolves in water,but form slurry suspension.Kaolin clay has very low cation exchange aptitude (approximately between 1 and 15 mEq 100g).This implies that it can only hold very minimal quantity of any class of cations at any given pH value.
