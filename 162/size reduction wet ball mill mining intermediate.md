## Effect of ball size and powder loading on the milling.
The particle size reduction results from the complicated dynamic interaction of the balls with turbulent slurry during the ball mill process,imposing a difficulty in quantitative interpretation of the observed phenomena of: (1) the existence of the optimized ball size at a given rotation speed; and (2Size Reduction &amp; Milling Applications Hosokawa Micron.Size Reduction &amp; Milling From lab pilot to production requirements,Hosokawa Micron Powder Systems offers a complete line of size reduction technologies.Whether you call it size reduction,micronization,milling,pulverizing,jet milling,air milling,or simply grinding,we can help.

## Dry Grinding VS Wet Grinding
Dry Grinding VS Wet Grinding.These observations are of some interest in view of a theory of the internal dynamics of the ball mill,propounded by one of the present writers,since that theory suggests that when the quantity of solid material is small in relation to the volume of the ball charge,the particle size reduction might be small.Size ReductionSize reduction technology has been widely used in mining and mineral processing for centuries to enable quicker and more effective recovery of valuable minerals and metals.The composition of MSW is so widely varied that machines designed for MSW must be robust enough to handle both soft,ductile materials as well as tough and resilient materials such as metal and dense plastics.
