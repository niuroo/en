## Concrete mix design using copper slag as fine aggregate
CONCLUSIONS Copper slag can be used as an alternative to natural sand in concrete.When copper slag(CS) is replaced with equivalent weight because of the fact more mortar is there to surround the aggregate therefore may workability will increase in terms of slump,however the compaction factor is more or less same comparable to that of the natural sand.Utilization of Copper slag in Bituminous mixUSE OF COPPER SLAG AS CONSTRUCTION MATERIAL IN BITUMINOUS PAVEMENT NKS PUNDHIR,C KAMARAJ AND PK NANDA COPPER SLAG CS WAS USED AS FINE AGGREGATE UP TO 20% IN THE DESIGN OF BITUMINOUS MIXES LIKE 12.
