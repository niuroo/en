## Alkali feldspar granite
Alkali feldspar granite,some varieties of which are called 'red granite',is a felsic igneous rock and a type of granite rich in the mineral potassium feldspar (K spar).It is a dense rock with a phaneritic texture.The abundance of K spar gives the rock a predominant pinkFeldsparThis is quite a number,and since feldspar is nearly always present in igneous rocks,most classification schemes depend on the amount and kind of feldspar In general terms,mafic and intermediate rocks contain plagioclase,with the more calcium present,the more mafic the resulting rock Orthoclase occurs only in the felsic igneous rocks

Quartz and fluorite are two very different minerals,each with a different hardness and crystal structure,although on the surface they look very similar.Both rocks come in clear or white tones,as well as purple,pink,blue and green.The visual similarities make themUniversity of Minnesota’s Mineral Pages: Plagioclase FeldsparQuartz: Quartz is a common mineral in many metamorphic and felsic igneous rocks that,like plagioclase,also has a non metallic luster and hardness greater than glass Unlike plagioclase,however,quartz does not exhibit cleavage,which easily distinguishes it from feldspar minerals

Orthoclase is a polymorph of other minerals that share the same chemistry,but have different crystal structur If positive identification between these minerals can not be made by field methods,then the specimen may simply be referred to as a potassium feldspar or K sparPlagioclase feldspars lack potassium,are light colored and are usually striatedQuartz and feldsparThe bad news is that sometimes the curved conchoidal surfaces can flash as well,but this usually happens with the clear varieties of quartz (which you already know isn't feldspar anyway) So,if the mineral has cleavage and sparkles,it may be feldspar If no sparkles,no matter how you rotate it in the light,it may be quartz
