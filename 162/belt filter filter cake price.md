## Filtration,cake filters &amp;amp; principles of cake filtration
Cake Filter • A filter cake is formed by the substances that are retained on a filter.• The filter cake grows in the course of filtration,becomes &quot;thicker&quot; as particulate matter is being retained.• With increasing layer thickness the flow resistance of the filter cake 11.Belt FilterThe gravity belt filter is a relatively simple device that is similar in general form to the horizontal belt filter (see Section 1.4.1.3) except separation is induced wholly by gravitational forces.Referring to Figure 1.55,the normally flocculated and dilute feed is introduced at one end of a continuously moving,semi permeable,belt.During translation with the belt,the ‘free water’ in.
