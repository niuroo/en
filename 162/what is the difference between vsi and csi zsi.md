## What is the difference between a current source inverter …
Lets see.A Grid Tied Inverter (GTI) is a Current Source Inverter.A Grid Tied Inverter requires a AC source (Utility,Local Grid,Some cases Genset) to operate.Without a AC (signal) source,it can’t do anything.Put it this way One Megawatt Grid.Z source inverter WikipediaThe main switching device of VSI and CSI are not interchangeable Advantages of ZSI The advantages of Z source inverter are listed as follows,The source can be either a voltage source or a current source The DC source of a ZSI can either be a battery,a diode rectifier or a thyristor converter,a fuel cell stack or a combination of these
