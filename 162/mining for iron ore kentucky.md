## Iron Ore: Sedimentary Rock Pictures,Definition & More
Earth's most important iron ore deposits are found in sedimentary rocks They formed from chemical reactions that combined iron and oxygen in marine and fresh waters The two most important minerals in these deposits are iron oxides: hematite (Fe 2 O 3) and magnetite (Fe 3 O 4 ) These iron ores have been mined to produce almost every iron and.Forward Mining HomepageForward Mining Ltd is seeking approval for the Rogetta Iron Ore Mine (the Project),south of Burnie in northern Tasmania.The project encompasses the extraction and processing of iron ore from a site just south east of Hampshire for trucking and export via Burnie Port,and all associated infrastructure.

## Iron Ore,Kentucky Geological Survey,University of Kentucky
The Kentucky Geological Survey gets many inquiries about iron slag or pig iron,a product of the iron furnaces.Pig iron is commonly mistaken for meteorites,and although this slag is metallic,heavy,and resembles meteorites,it is just a byproduct of a past mining industry.Tennessee MinesIn 1870,however,the census reported only six producers of iron ore in the state producing just over 34,600 tons of ore By 1910 the state reported forty six producing iron mines.Pit mining along surface outcrops had almost disappeared,largely replaced by underground mining in the Euchee,Rockwood Cardiff,and Chamberlain areas of central East Tennessee and the La Follette area of northeast.
