How do I Calculate Density? Calculating Density If I have a rock that is made up of two minerals,one with a density of 2.8 g cm 3,and one with a density of 3.5 g cm 3,the rock will have a density between 3.5 and 2.8 g cm 3,not a density of 6.3 g cm 3.Wisconsin Geological &amp; Natural History Survey &#187; …There are three types of density in rocks: dry density,wet density,and grain density.The data table lists the dry,wet,and grain densities of the samples.Additional wet densities for Wisconsin rocks can be found in “ Density and Magnetic Susceptibility of Wisconsin Rock,” by S.I.Dutch,R.C.Boyle,S.K.Jones Hoffbeck,and S.M.Vandenbush ( Geoscience Wisconsin,Vol.15,p.53 70).

## Density of Plastics Material: Technical Properties Table
Density measures the mass per unit volume.It is calculated by dividing the mass of the material by the volume and is normally expressed in g cm 3.The density of a plastic sample may change due to change in crystallinity,loss of plasticizers,absorption of solvent,etc.Particle DensityAggregate particle density usually is not directly related to concrete performance in the materials sense,but might be relevant from a structural standpoint (e.g.gravity structures).It is,however,an essential property for concrete mix design and also for calculating the volume of concrete produced from a certain mass of materials (the yield).
