## Crusher
A crusher is a machine designed to reduce large rocks into smaller rocks,gravel,or rock dust.Crushers may be used to reduce the size,or change the form,of waste materials so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled,or to reduce the size of a solid mix of raw materials (as in rock ore),so that pieces of different composition can be differentiated.,Vertical shaft impact crusher,…Based on the analysis of the dynamics of impact jaw crusher,the mobile parameters and the changing rules of inertial force (inertial moment) are obtained; the determination of the balance mass and setting angle according to the minimising left inertial force is presented; a calculation formula for determining the optimizing balance mass and setting angle is also described in this paper.
