Concrete blocks also come in half sizes,which are helpful in reducing the need to cut blocks in the field at corners or the end of walls.The architect should always attempt to design buildings using the nominal dimensions to the nearest half block size to reduce waste and labor due to cut blocks.Design Guide VictoriaSizes Blocks have a face dimension (nominal) of 400mm long x 200mm high.Because an allowance is made for 10mm wide mortar joints,the actual face size of the block is 390mm x 190mm.There are 12.5 blocks per m2.1 metre 1 metre.

Composition Concrete blocks are made from cast concrete (e.g.Portland cement and aggregate,usually sand and fine gravel,for high density blocks).Lower density blocks may use industrial wastes,such as fly ash or bottom ash,as an aggregate.Recycled materials,such as post consumer glass,slag cement,or recycled aggregate,are often used in the composition of the blocks.What Is the Weight of One Standard Concrete Block? …The weight of one standard concrete block ranges between 38 and 50 pounds.All standard concrete blocks have a uniform size; however,the weight of each block may differ owing to a number of factors.The size of a standard concrete block is 8 inches in depth,8.
