## How to Calculate the Mass of a Sphere: 13 Steps (with.
 · To calculate the mass of a sphere,start by finding the sphere's volume using the formula: V = 4 over 3 × πr cubed,where r is the radius of the sphere.Once you have the volume,look up the density for the material the sphere is made out of and convert the density so the units are the same in both the density and volume.Shot (pellet) WikipediaShot is a collective term for small balls or pellets,often made of lead.These were the original projectiles for shotguns and are still fired primarily from shotguns and less commonly from riot guns and grenade launchers,although shot shells are available in many pistol calibers in a configuration called "bird shot","rat shot",or "snake shot".Lead shot is also used for a variety of other.

## Mass,Density &amp; Volume Calculator
An object's density is represented by a ratio of its mass to volume.The units,used for measurements are,therefore,mass per unit volume.Mass,if we look from a physicist's perspective,can be defined as a measure of the quantity that is inside a body,excluding such factors as the volume of an object or any forces that might be acting on the object.Density of Steel AMESDENSITY OF STEEL.The density of steel is in the range of 7.75 and 8.05 g cm 3 (7750 and 8050 kg m 3 or 0.280 and 0.291 lb in 3).The theoretical density of mild steel (low carbon steel) is about 7.87 g cm 3 (0.284 lb in 3).Density of carbon steels,alloy steels,tool steels and stainless steels are shown below in g cm 3,kg m 3 and lb in 3.
