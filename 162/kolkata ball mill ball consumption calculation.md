## Calculate Ball Mill Grinding Capacity
The sizing of ball mills and ball milling circuits from laboratory grinding tests is largely a question of applying empirical equations or factors based on accumulated experience.Different manufacturers use different methods,and it is difficult to check the validity of the sizing estimates when estimates from different sources are widely divergent.It is especially difficult to teach mill.Ball Mill Design Power CalculationBall Mill Power Design Calculation Example #2 In Example No.1 it was determined that a 1400 HP wet grinding ball mill was required to grind 100 TPH of material with a Bond Work Index of 15 ( guess what mineral type it is ) from 80% passing &#188; inch to 80% passing 100 mesh in closed circuit.

## Ball Mills
Ball Mills are generally used to grind material 1 4 inch and finer,down to the particle size of 20 to 75 microns.To achieve a reasonable efficiency with ball mills,they must be operated in a closed system,with oversize material continuously being recirculated back into the mill to be reduced.how to calculate power consumption in ball millTECHNICAL NOTES 8 GRINDING R P King Mineral Technologies,ball mill power calculation,Figure 85 Effect of mill filling on power draft for ball mills The data,A simple equation for calculating net power draft is,Austin's formula gives slightly higher values than Morrell's for mills that have length equal Power Consumption.
