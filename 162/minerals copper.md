## COPPER (Cu)
Native copper (copper found in a chemically uncombined state) has been mined for centuries and now is all but depleted as an economically viable ore.Other copper minerals are far more economical to mine and purify into metallic copper that is used for wiring,electrical components,pennies and other coins,tubing and many other applications.Copper oresThe main copper sulphide minerals are chalcopyrite (CuFeS2) chalcocite (Cu2S),covellite (CuS),bornite (Cu5FeS4),tetrahedrite ((Cu,Fe)12Sb4S13) and enargite (Cu3AsS4).The largest source of copper is from porphyry ore deposits in which one or a combination.

## Copper
Globally,diminishing copper grades,a dwindling pipeline of new copper projects and expansions,and an expected exhaustion of key copper mines point towards a tightening supply market.Furthermore,looking at long term copper market dynamics,demand is expected to rise due to the increasing use of the metal in new technologies and current supply is unlikely to keep pace with this growing.Copper Michigan Rocks &amp; MineralsCopper is found as a pure metal in nature,and this was the first source of the metal to be used by humans,ca.8,000 BC.A freshly exposed surface of pure copper has a reddish orange color.

## Copper
Copper is one of the few metals that can occur in nature in a directly usable metallic form (native metals).This led to very early human use in several regions,from c.8000 BC.Thousands of years later,it was the first metal to be smelted from sulfide ores,c.5000 BC; the first metal to be cast into a shape in a mold,c.4000 BC; and the first metal to be purposefully alloyed with another.CopperMinerals Overview of Minerals Chromium Copper Wilson Disease Fluoride Iodine Iron Selenium Zinc Test your knowledge Undernutrition Undernutrition is a deficiency of calories or of one or more essential nutrients.Some medical conditions greatly increase the.
