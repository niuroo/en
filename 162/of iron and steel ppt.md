## Difference Between Cast Iron and Steel
Difference Between Cast Iron and Steel Definition Cast Iron is an alloy made from Iron and Carbon with a weight percentage around 4% along with Silicon and carbide impurities.Steel is mainly made of Iron alloying with a controlled amount Carbon roughly Steel.An Introduction to Steel and Steel Metallurgy• An alloy (mixture) of iron and carbon (&lt;2.0%) • Plain Carbon Steel contains Manganese (&gt;0.25%) • Alloy steels contain additional alloying elements,typically C,Mn,Si,Cr,Ni,Mo,Al and sometimes Ti,V,Nb,W,Co.• Typically Steels have 95% or more Iron with

## Chapter 73.Iron and Steel
The steel industry is a major generator of carbon dioxide,more from the use of carbon as a reducing agent in the production of iron from iron ore than from its use as a source of energy.By 1990,through a variety of measures for blast furnace coke rate reduction,waste heat recovery and energy saving,carbon dioxide emissions by the iron and steel industry had been reduced to 47% of the.Introduction to Iron and SteelIntroduction to Iron and Steel A few definitions and general descriptions are in order Pig iron: Raw iron,the immediate product of smelting iron ore with coke and limestone in a blast furnace.Pig iron has a very high carbon content,typically 5%,which makes it.

## Iron and steel
Iron and steel consist of grains made of different kinds of iron and carbon,some of which are hard,while others are soft.When the harder kinds predominate,you get a hard and brittle material; when there are more softer kinds in between,the material can bend and?.Properties &amp; Uses of Steel SciencingMost of the steel produced today is simply called carbon steel,or plain carbon steel,even though it may contain metals besides iron and carbon,such as silicon and manganese.The amount of steel variation may not look significant on the surface,because carbon never makes up more than 1.5 percent of steel.
