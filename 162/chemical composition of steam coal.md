Thus,coal is considered as a non renewable natural resource,because,when coal is mined out and used,they cannot be regenerated again easily.There are different types of coal.They are ranked based on their properties and composition.American Chemical SocietyThe partial least squares regression (PLSR) method is used to develop empirical correlations for predicting coal ash fusion temperatures (AFTs) under reducing conditions and the temperature of critical viscosity (Tcv) from the chemical composition.The database used in this work includes 433 ash samples from coals of different sources.PLSR is a powerful tool that is able to identify the most.

## Bituminous coal coal classification Britannica
Bituminous coal,also called soft coal,the most abundant form of coal,intermediate in rank between subbituminous coal and anthracite according to the coal classification used in the United States and Canada.In Britain bituminous coal is commonly called “ steam coal,” and in Germany the term Steinkohle (“rock coal”) is used.American Chemical SocietyHyperCoal was produced from coal by a solvent extraction method.The effect of the partial pressure of steam on the gasification rate and gas composition at temperatures of 600,650,700,and 750 &#176;C was examined.The gasification rate decreased with decreasing steam partial pressure.The reaction order with respect to steam partial pressure was between 0.2 and 0.5.The activation energy for.
