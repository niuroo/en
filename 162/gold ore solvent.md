Gold is stripped from the extraction phase with pure water,from which the gold can be reduced either chemically or electrochemically.The invention relates to a method for recovering gold by solvent extraction from an acidic chloride containing aqueous solution or from slurry containing gold bearing solids using a diester based reagent that is poorly soluble in water as organic extraction.GoldThe latter solvent is the basis for the cyanide process that is used to recover gold from low grade ore.The degree of purity of native gold,bullion (bars or ingots of unrefined gold),and refined gold is stated in terms of gold content.“Fineness” defines gold content.
