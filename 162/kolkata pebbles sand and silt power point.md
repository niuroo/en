As rocks and pebbles roll along the bottom of flowing water,they bump and scrape against each other (abrasion),causing these rocks to become rounded and smooth.Abrasion WIND blows sand and silt against exposed rock eventually wearing away the rock’s surface.Soil 3Soil 3 Soil Composition The ideal composition of soil,25% Air,25 % H2O,45% Mineral Matter 5% Organic Matter.Particles The texture of a soil depends on the relative mixture of sand,silt and clay particles.The most common method of classifying soils is based on the percentage clay in the oil.E.g.Soils that contain 0 5 % clay are known as sandy soils.
