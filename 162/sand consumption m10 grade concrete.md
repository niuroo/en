## Concrete Grades Different Types &amp; Specification
The concrete grades converted various mixes into the two proportions.Like example,differentiate with M20 concrete,mixing proportions will be the 1:1.5:3 sand: cement: coarse aggregates ratio.The Concrete grade are denoted strength by M5,M10,M20 according.Grade of ConcreteIn the grade of concretes like M10,M20,M30,etc.“M” stands for Mix of the ratio of cement:sand: aggregate and 10 20 30 Stands for Compressive Strength.Concrete less than M20 grade should not be used in the RCC work as per code IS 456:2000.PQC stands
