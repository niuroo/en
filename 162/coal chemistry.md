## Petroleum and Coal
Coal Gasification As early as 1800,coal gas was made by heating coal in the absence of air.Coal gas is rich in CH 4 and gives off up to 20.5 kJ per liter of gas burned.Coal gas or town gas,as it was also known became so popular that most major cities and many small towns had a local gas house in which it was generated,and gas burners were adjusted to burn a fuel that produced 20.5 kJ L.
