## Construction aggregate
Construction aggregate,or simply aggregate,is a broad category of coarse to medium grained particulate material used in construction,including sand,gravel,crushed stone,slag,recycled concrete and geosynthetic aggregates.Aggregates are the most mined materials in the world.Aggregates are a component of composite materials such as.7.7 Aggregate Crushing Value and 10% Fines Value 7.7.1 Aggregate Crushing …crushes the aggregate to a degree which is dependent on the aggregate’s crushing resistance.This degree is assessed by a sieving test on the crushed specimen and is taken as the Aggregate Crushing Value.7.7.1.4 Sampling.The sample used for this test

## 7 LAB TESTS ON AGGREGATE TO CHECK QUALITY FOR USE …
One of the model in which pavement material can fail is by crushing under compressive stress.A test is standardized by IS: 2386 part IV and used to determine the crushing strength of aggregates.The aggregate crushing value provides a relative measure ofAggregateFACT (10% Fines Aggregate Crushing Test) measure the crushing strength of broken rock.These results do not necessarily relate to the ﬂexural or compressive strength of concrete made with that aggregate,but are a useful index of overall quality.10% FACT.
