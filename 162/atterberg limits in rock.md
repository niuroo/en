## Atterberg limits SpringerLink
Atterberg Limits are the water contents which define transitions between the solid,plastic,and liquid states of a given soil material The tests are restricted to cohesive soils with appreciable silt or clay fraction,and cannot be conducted readily on either sands or silts with a high sand fractionShrinkage Plastic Liquid LimitShrinkage Plastic Liquid Limit The Shrinkage limit,Plastic Limit and Liquid limit together form the Atterberg limits,important for the effect of water on clay or silt soils.The relationship between the three is that the shrinkage limit defines when dry soil becomes friable,the plastic limit is where the soil becomes malleable and the liquid limit where the soil becomes liquid and able.

## STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE NO 54 ATTERBERG LIMITS
Atterberg limits tests consist of two tests called Plastic Limit,PL,and Liquid Limit,LL The tests determine the consistency of clay and are used to characterize the fine grained fractions of soils The liquid limit,plastic limit and plasticity,Questa Rock Pile Stability Study SOP 54v7 Atterberg Limits,Soil classificationConsistency limits and plasticity Consistency varies with the water content of the soil The consistency of a soil can range from (dry) solid tosemi solidto plastic to liquid(wet) The water contents at which the consistency changes from one state to the next are called consistency limits(or Atterberg limits)

Sampling is carried out in order that soil and rock description,and laboratory testing can be carried out Laboratory tests (Chapter 8) typically consist of: 1 index tests (for example,unconfined compressive strength tests on rock); 2 classification tests (for example,Atterberg limit tests on clays); and 3
