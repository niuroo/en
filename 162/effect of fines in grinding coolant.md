## What Machine Coolant Does
What Machine Coolant Does To reasonably evaluate the choices available in machine coolants,it's good to remember why you're using coolants in the first place.Metal‑removal techniques generate friction,which in turn generates heat,and excessive heat in metal removal is always a detriment.How Temperature Affect Grinding EfficiencyThe effects of temperature on autogenous grinding can be immediately divided into rheological effects and mechanical effects.The rheological effects are a result of the substantial increase in the viscosity of water as the freezing point is approached.The change in apparent slurry viscosity which results from changing temperature is shown in Figure 1.As can be seen,the effect at high.

## Machine Coolant Health and Safety
Machine coolant alone can be dangerous.It is not meant to be breathed.Fortunately air handling equipment is easy to install and pretty inexpensive.The real health problems arise when machine coolant is mis handled and bacteria in machine coolant is allowed to grow and metals are allowed to contaminate the machine coolant.FORMULATION OF GRINDING COOLANT&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;A new coolant for grinding the surface of the substrate of a magnetic recording medium is disclosed.The new coolant maintains the removal rate at about 1 mil min even after 58 runs after dress.On the other hand,the removal rate using a commercially available coolant drops to less than 0.3 mil min after only about 35 runs after dress.

The main purpose of a coolant is to provide cooling effect on grinding wheel and work piece at the time of machining process and also to lubricate the work piece surface.Cooling of the tool and the work piece is very important to terminate the unnecessary effects of heat on the work piece,while tool also cures the work piece from corrosion.Coolant setup for grinding&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Coolant can go rancid and become stinky so good to have a way to clean tank once in a while.Wheel dust and perhaps some coolants may not be safe to breathe.My lungs seem Ok after a lot of grinding but I have begun to wear a mask with some most grinding
