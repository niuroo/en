## Gold extraction
Gold extraction refers to the processes required to extract gold from its ores.This may require a combination of comminution,mineral processing,hydrometallurgical,and pyrometallurgical processes to be performed on the ore.Gold mining from alluvium ores was once achieved by techniques associated with placer mining such as simple gold panning and sluicing,resulting in direct recovery of.
