## THE PHYSICS OF &quot;FALLING CURTAIN&quot; DRY MAGNETIC.
The separation process in a &quot;falling curtain&quot; of particles is investigated in detail.Each particle experiences gravity,air drag and magnetic forces,as well as collisions with other particles.A simple kinetic theory model is used to model these processes and the separa tion distance between two different minerals is calculated.Magnetic separation techniques Springer Link(500 2 000 ml) can be separated into enriched frac tions by centrifugation using either zonal or elutria tion rotors (3).In contrast to work on either the gravitational or inertial separation of cells,little progress has been made on magnetic separation procedures.This is probably because few cells are intrinsically magnet .
