MOIL is continuously carrying out exploration for location of new additional reserves.The main focus area is to prove depth extensions of the ore zone within the existing operating mines.MOIL has a separate exploration wing with its own fleet of equipment.On an average about 2500 meters of diamond drilling is done per year which proves about 1.0 million tonnes of additional reserves.MinesMines are places and areas where various minable resources (e.g.ores,essences,stones,gems,etc.) can be mined.These may be above ground (quarries or outcrops) or underground (mines) and are scattered all over Gielinor.Also,some of these mines have access requirements (e.g.having membership,wearing carrying certain items,and or completing a certain quest).
