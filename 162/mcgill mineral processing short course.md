## Mining Engineering < Colorado School of Mines
Program Description.Mining engineering is a broad profession,which embraces all required activities to facilitate the recovery of valuable minerals and products from the earth’s crust for the benefit of humanity.It is one of the oldest engineering professions,which continues to grow in importance.It has often been said: “If it can't be grown then it must be mined.”Short Courses Wits UniversityPostgraduate courses can be taken as stand alone short courses,either on an attendance only basis or to obtain a Wits Certificate of Competence.The School supports access to all courses through a combination of recognition of prior learning and suitable postgraduate diplomas in engineering for all non engineering qualified persons.
