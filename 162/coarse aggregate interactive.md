## bulk density of aggregate for 12mm
Density of Coarse Aggregate Aggregate which occupy nearly 80 to 85 % volume of concrete are most important part of the concrete or RCC.However,it is well recognize that physical,chemical and thermal properties of aggregate substantially influence the properties and performance of concrete.Coarse Aggregate Specific GravityAggregate Segregation Based on several articles (Kennedy et.al.1987 [2]; Brown and Brownfield,1988 [3]; Williams et.al.1996a [4] and 1996b [5]; Khedaywi and White,1996 [6]; AASHTO,1997 [7]) the commonly accepted qualitative definition of aggregate segregation is “the non uniform distribution of coarse and fine aggregate components within the asphalt mixture.”
