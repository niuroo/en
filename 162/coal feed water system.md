## Feed Water and Steam Circuit of Boiler Electrical4U
24 02 2012&#0183;&#32;There are different components present in feed water and steam circuit of boiler and we should know some essential components of these circuit and these are Economizer,boiler drums,water tubes,and super heater Economizer Economizer is a heat exchanger which takes heat from the flue gas,and increases the temperature of feed water coming from feed water common header to about,Lime feed system and slurry make up plant Sodimate IncTo ensure optimal pH regulation,the coal fired plant needed to find a better way to feed the hydrated lime into their slurry process.One of the issues of the lime pH regulation system was the excessive noise and vibration created by the unloader vibrators.

## Coaxial coal water paste feed system for gasification,
17 03 1995&#0183;&#32;This invention advantageously provides an improved feed system for feeding a coal water paste material,and if desired a sorbent material such as calcium carbonate or dolomite,upwardly into a pressurized coal fluidized bed (PCFB) reactor,so as to provide uniform atomization and carbonization and or combustion of the coal therein and produce a clean fuel gas productFeedwater heaterA feedwater heater is a power plant component used to pre heat water delivered to a steam generating boiler.[1][2][3] Preheating the feedwater reduces the irreversibilities involved in steam generation and therefore improves the thermodynamic efficiency of the system.[4] This reduces plant operating costs and also helps to avoid thermal shock.
