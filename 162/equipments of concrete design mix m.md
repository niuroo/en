## Concrete Mix Design
Design Mix Concrete • The concrete mix produced under quality control keeping in view the strength,durability,and workability is called the design Mix.• Others factors like compaction equipment's available,curing method adopted,type of cement,quality of fine and coarse aggregate etc.have to be kept in mind before arriving at the mix proportion.Analysis on Mix Design of High Strength Concrete (M100)4.Casting of samples for mix design The size of the cube Specimen is (150x150x150) mm.A total of 5 trials for mix design were casted.In each trial 6 cubes are casted.A total of 30 cubes are casted for the mix design of high strength concrete.5.Curing of
