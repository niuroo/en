## Inﬂuence Zone for End Bearing of Piles in Sand
Inﬂuence Zone for End Bearing of Piles in Sand J.Yang,M.ASCE1 Abstract: An attempt is made to establish an analytically based estimate of the inﬂuence zone surrounding the tip of a loaded pile in sand.In the framework of the cavity expansion theory and aWhat Is Concrete Slump? HunkerAccordingly,its slump rating indicates what construction application the concrete is good for.The higher the slump,the more workable the concrete.If the slump of concrete is too low,it won't shape very easily.If it is too high,you run the risk of having the gravel
