## China’s Steel Industry
China’s steel industry has grown rapidly in recent decades,with China now the world’s largest producer and consumer of steel.this has resulted in a sharp increase in demand for iron ore and coal,Australia’s two largest exports,which are key inputs for the steelmaking process.thisIron Ore ScienceDirectThis drop in iron ore price is attributed to a cooling of the Chinese economy and an oversupply of iron ore from the major iron ore producers.This has put considerable pressure on the higher cost iron ore producers to reduce costs,and even the major producers such as BHP Billiton,Rio Tinto,Vale,Fortescue Metals Group (FMG),and Kumba Iron Ore at the lower end of the cost curve are under.
