## Vertical Blender
Vertical Blenders are an excellent design alternative for applications that are shear sensitive or where space on the plant floor is at a minimum.The gentle blending action of the slow turning blending screw is far gentler than that of a horizontal blender.How to mount a vertical shaft for an anemometer? : …The shaft will need to have a disc halfway up (to mount a magnet for the reed switch hall effect sensor for the RPM measurement).The cups will be mounted at the top of the shaft.Here's an old design I created I have since realised that it would be best for the cups to be on the top instead of hanging below,for structural and airflow reasons.

## VERTICAL AXIS WIND TURBINES mragheb
This led to the design of a straight bladed vertical axis wind turbine designated as the H rotor blade configuration,blades,which are attached to both the top and the bottom of a rotating vertical shaft The wind blowing over the airfoil contours of the blade creates an aerodynamic lift and actuallyDo Vertical Pumps Need Alignment? VibrAlignThe OJT portion of a recent training class involved a large vertical Floway pump driven by an 800 HP GE electric motor,rotating at 1200 RPM,utilizing a rigid coupling with a piloted fit Since we didn’t want the coupling and shaft stiffness to influence the alignment readings,the decision was made to remove the coupling bolts and rest the.
