## Eddy Current Separation
Since eddy current separation depends on the levitation of the conducting component by the magnetic field (by magnetic repulsion),the ratio of conductivity to density indicates a measure of selectivity of separation.The values shown in Table 3.2 indicate,for example,aluminum has a ratio of conductivity to density almost twice as great as for copper (Sommer and Kenny,1975),which suggests.Al2O3 and TiO2 Atomic Layer Deposition on Copper for …Al2O3 and TiO2 atomic layer deposition (ALD) were employed to develop an ultrathin barrier film on copper to prevent water corrosion.The strategy was to utilize Al2O3 ALD as a pinhole free barrier and to protect the Al2O3 ALD using TiO2 ALD.An initial set of experiments was performed at 177 &#176;C to establish that Al2O3 ALD could nucleate on copper and produce a high quality Al2O3 film.In.
