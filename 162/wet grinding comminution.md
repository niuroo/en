The comminution takes place in bead mills,especially in the wet grinding process in so called agitator bead mills.Both have in common that a rotating agitator with discs or special agitator units drive the beads and thus the moving beads transfer their energy (impact,shear,shock) to the particles and cause them to collapse.Comminution Theory &amp; Process EquipmentFor wet grinding in the finer size ranges wet classifiers and or cyclones are employed,generally to make a size separation from 20 mesh down to 325 mesh.Under dry grinding conditions air classifiers are used to make the size classification.

## Comminution
Comminution by grinding (or milling) is perhaps the most obvious way of attempting to increase the surface area of a given mass of solid.With some layer structures such as clays and graphite,an appreciable increase in specific area can be achieved by prolonged grinding ( Gregg,1961 ),but this is not on the scale required to give a highly active adsorbent.Comminution of Pillsobtain a suspension by a wet grinding,which can be diluted even further.Classical methods of the comminution with the mortar mill offer the advantage of a gentle comminution i.e.the thermal load of the sample is kept at a minimum.
