## Different Types Of Cast Iron White cast iron,Grey cast …
Malleable cast iron is basically white iron that undergoes heat treatment to convert the carbide into graphite.The resultant cast iron has properties that vary from both grey and white cast iron.In case of malleable cast iron,the graphite structure is formed into irregularly shaped spheroidal particles rather than flakes that are usually present in gray cast iron.Different types of iron and its material propertiesPig Iron from ore contains three basic forms of Iron: 1.Cast iron (Made from Cupola furnace) 2.Wrought Iron (Made from Pudding furnace) 3.Steel (Made from Bessemer converter) Wrought Iron and its properties: Wrought Iron is a mechanical mixture of pure
