## Alkali soil
Alkali,or Alkaline,soils are clay soils with high pH (&gt; 8.5),a poor soil structure and a low infiltration capacity.Often they have a hard calcareous layer at 0.5 to 1 metre depth.Alkali soils owe their unfavorable physico chemical properties mainly to the dominating presence of sodium carbonate,which causes the soil to swell and difficult to clarify settle.The composition of limestone What is limestone? …Limestone is a sedimentary rock,most of which originally formed by the accumulation of sediments on the sea floor (although some formed in fresh water).These sediments,which were afterwards turned to limestone rock,are composed of over 50 per cent carbonate minerals.
