## Basalt Rock Properties and Uses
Basalt rock is one of the most abundant components in the Earth's crust,and is commonly formed due to lava flow.In this article,we will take a look at the properties of this igneous rock,and the various ways in which it is useful to us.BasaltBasalt is an igneous rock that contains more than 45 and less than 52% of SiO 2 and less than five percent of total alkalies (K 2 O + Na 2 O) 3.Neighboring rock types like basaltic andesite,basanite,picrite (picrobasalt),trachybasalt and even more distant rocks like phonotephrite or andesite may have very similar look and can be easily mistaken for basalt in many cases.
