## Cryogenic Grinding &amp; Attritors
The introduction of lower temperatures during cryomilling curbs recrystallization and embrittles materials so they can be fractured more easily with mechanical milling.Cryogenic grinding is often performed in impact mills and hammer mills,but the use of an internally agitated ball mill,like an Attritor,can provide additional benefits.
