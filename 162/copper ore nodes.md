## Large Resource Deposits Subnautica Wiki Fandom
Large Resource Deposits are large quantities of a single Raw Material found in Subnautica.Unlike stone outcrops,the materials cannot be harvested by hand; instead they must be broken down using the Prawn Suit Drill Arm.Trivia Kyanite is one of the few resources in Subnautica that is not guaranteed to eject smaller pieces when drilling chunks from a large node.This is not a bug.On the.World of Warcraft Mining: Finding Copper Ore DepositsMining copper ore is arguably easier for Alliance players Elwynn Forest,Westfall,and all of the dwarven countries are rich with copper ore nodes.Loch Modan,Dun Morogh,and to a lesser extent,Elwynn Forest,are the best locations to farm copper ore for Alliance WoW players,however.
