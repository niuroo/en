## Eskom and ash management
Larger particles of ash,called coarse ash,which make up the rest of the ash produced at the power station,drop down from the furnace and collect at the bottom in the ash hopper of the boiler.The fly ash (also particulate matter) is removed from the flue gas stream (exhaust gases from the boiler) by means of electrostatic precipitators or bag filter systems.CHAPTER 4 PROPERTIES OF MATERIALS 4.1 Fly AshCHAPTER 4 PROPERTIES OF MATERIALS 4.1 Fly Ash Fly ash,the fine particulate waste material produced by pulverized coal based thermal power station,is an environmental pollutant,it has a potential to be a resource material.It is nowadays used in

## Chapter 1
Coarse ash particles,referred to as bottom ash or slag,fall to the bottom of the combustion chamber,while the lighter fine ash particles,termed fly ash,remain suspended in the flue gas.Prior to exhausting the flue gas,fly ash is removed by particulate emission control devices,such as electrostatic precipitators or filter fabric baghouses (see Figure 1).Fly ashFly ash material solidifies while suspended in the exhaust gases and is collected by electrostatic precipitators or filter bags.Since the particles solidify rapidly while suspended in the exhaust gases,fly ash particles are generally spherical in shape and range in size from 0.5 &#181;m to 300 &#181;m.to 300 &#181;m.
