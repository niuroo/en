## Cyanide
Cyanide is mainly produced for the mining of gold and silver: It helps dissolve these metals and their ores.In the cyanide process,finely ground high grade ore is mixed with the cyanide (concentration of about two kilogram NaCN per tonne); low grade ores are stacked into heaps and sprayed with a cyanide solution (concentration of about one kilogram NaCN per ton).The effect of gold mining and processing on …The results of cyanide analysis in soil samples show that cyanide concentration in the soils near the newly built tailing dam is much higher than that in the vicinity of the old tailing dam.The high concentration of fluorine in the drinking water of the Muteh village is the main reason of the observed dental fluorosis symptoms seen in the inhabitants.
