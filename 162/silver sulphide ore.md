## Silver
Silver is similar in its physical and chemical properties to its two vertical neighbours in group 11 of the periodic table,copper and gold.Its 47 electrons are arranged in the configuration [Kr]4d 10 5s 1,similarly to copper ([Ar]3d 10 4s 1) and gold ([Xe]4f 14 5d 10 6s 1); group 11 is one of the few groups in the d block which has a completely consistent set of electron configurations.Nitric acid leaching of silver sulphide precipitatesLeaching of silver sulphide precipitates with nitric acid was performed at a variety of temperatures,pressures,acid concentrations and solids concentrations,with a maximum extraction of 96.1% achieved by leaching at 150 C,1100 kPa(g),and 9.6% solids with.

## Silver Sulphide Assaying
There has been considerable discussion of late as to the best assay method for determining the silver contents of sulphides of silver resulting from the leaching of silver ores,and also as to the relative merits of the crucible and the scorification method for the determination of the silver contents of ores.Owing to the great depression in the silver market,these are questions of.Ore mineralogy and silver distribution at the R&#228;vliden N …Since the silver bearing minerals in the massive to semi massive sulphide mineralization and the two varieties of hanging wall mineralization contains the same metals,the mineralization in the hanging wall may have formed by late stage remobilization of ore

Acanthite is the most important silver ore next to galena.Actually there is an argument to be made that acanthite could be the most important silver ore.Galena is a lead ore that often contains enough silver (usually about 1%) that when it is processed for its lead content the by product silver supplies the majority of the world's needs.LIST OF ORES AND THEIR NAMES SULPHIDE ORESULPHIDE ORE PbS Galena HgS Cinnabar ZnS Zinc blende Cu2S Copper glance CuFeS2 Copper Pyrites (Chalcopyrite) FeS2 Iron pyrites or Fool's gold Ag2S Silver glance or Argentite Cu2S.Ag2S Copper silver glance Ag2S.Sb2S3 CaF2 Na3AlF6.
