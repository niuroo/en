## Sponge Iron
Chemical method using iron sponge bed [hydrated iron oxide (Fe 2 O 3) in porous media] is commonly used to convert H 2 S in biogas into iron sulfide (Fe 2 S 3).The regeneration of saturated iron sponges can be simply achieved by aeration to convert the iron sulfide back into iron oxide and elemental sulfur.Extract more sponge iron to boost steel production jobslow grade sponge iron Sponge iron plants it is appropriate to utilize the cheap and abundantly available low grade iron ore fines after suitable beneficiation and then agglomerating those as pellets In this way Corn Stover Pellet Mill In the past,straw burning has been.
