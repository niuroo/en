## Ore Milling
Edison had developed an electromagnetic ore separator in 1880 while working on electric light and power.In this device,sand from tailings or crushed rock was poured through a hopper so that it fell in a thin,broad stream in front of an electromagnet that attracted magnetic particles,such as iron,into one receptacle while non magnetic particles fell straight through into another bin.Edison and Ore RefiningA tower containing magnetic ore separator at Edison's Ogdensburg,N.J mine.Courtesy: National Park Service,Edison National Historic Site.When Thomas Edison left the electric light industry in 1892 (a result of the merger of Edison General Electric with.
