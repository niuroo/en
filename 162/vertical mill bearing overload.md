## What sort of bearings can be used to support a shaft whose.
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Actually for a vertical shaft(where there is a heavy axial load) the best bearings are taper roller bearings.If the load is heavy this is the best.But for light.Benchtop Machine Shop: Mill: Spindle Bearings&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Mill: Spindle Bearings.Because of the vertical bearing orientation in the mini mill,grease retention is an issue,and I also found contamination of the lower bearing is an issue.the high static load from pressing can damage both the races and the balls themselves,greatly reduci
