This is a rugged sensor and continues to be used for force and weight measurement in rolling mills and strip mills.Weighing load cell applications Load cells representedSAG Mill Control: It Shouldnt be that HardSAG mill control fundamentally means managing the load in the mill by adjusting the feed rate of ore to the mill and or manipulating the rotational speed of the mill.The best way to measure load is to mount the mill on load cells.The load cells are calibrated to measure the total weight of water,grinding media (balls) and ore in the mill.

## What is a load cell? How does a load cell work? HBM
The intended load for a load cell is always aligned in the direction of the center of the earth,in other words in the direction of gravity.Only that force component of the load should be acquired.That is not the case for force sensors,which are similar in design,and are also frequently specified as &quot;load cells&quot;: They are usually designed to acquire loads that occur in all directions.Load Cell 20151009&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;These load cells are particularly stiff,have very good resonance values,and tend to have long life cycles in application.Strain gauge load cells work on the principle that the strain gauge (a.
