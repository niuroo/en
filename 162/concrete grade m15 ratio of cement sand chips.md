## Difference Between Concrete and Cement gharpedia
Difference between concrete and cement is the case of mistaken identities.Common people should know the basic difference between cement and concrete to overcome the misunderstanding.You can not cast slab,wall or column with cement,but you can do it with concrete.There is also one myth that for higher grade concrete need more cement.Grade of ConcreteConcrete Grade Mix Ratio (cement: sand: aggregates) Compressive Strength MPa (N mm2) psi Normal Grades of Concrete M5 1: 5: 10 5 MPa 725 psi M7.5 1: 4: 8 7.psi M10 1 : 3: 6 psi M15 1: 2: 4 psi M20 1: 1.5 : 3 20 MPa
