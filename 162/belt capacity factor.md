## Understanding Conveyor Belt Calculations Sparks Belting
Common Calculations for Proper Design Belt Length When the head and tail pulley are the same size: L=(D+d) 2 x 3.1416+2C When one pulley is larger than the other pulley: L=(D+d) 2 x 3.1416+2C+(D d) 2 4c Belt Speed Expressed in feet per minute (FPM) SConveyor Belt Calculating ChartThe length factor,f = (L + 10H),represented on the chart by the lines 500,600,700,etc.is a developed factor equal to the sum of the length of the belt and ten times the difference in elevation between the head and tail pulleys.
