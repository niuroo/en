## What happens when acid reacts with limestone? Questions,
Jun 15,2008&#0183;&#32;Limestone is mostly made up of the mineral calcium carbonate (CaCO3) This is not very soluble,so rocks don't dissolve very quickly But if you add an acid,you add hydrogen ions (H+),which will react with the carbonate to form hydrogen carbonate HCO3 ions,which are very soluble in water,and the limestone will dissolve Or,if there is more acid,two hydrogen,Indiana Limestone City University of New YorkFor a rock,the Indiana Limestone is chemically pure and consistent,being composed of &gt;97% calcite The combination of these physical and chemical characteristics make the Indiana Limestone well suited to building because: It is more durable than a typical limestone
