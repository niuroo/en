## Lightweight Foamed Concrete: Foaming Agent
Excellent strength and thermal insulation properties means the foamed concrete produced from EABASSOC Foaming Agent is ideal for a wide range of applications.EABASSOC Foaming Agent: Making Foam When processed through a foam generator,a solution of EABASSOC Foaming Agent in water creates a stiff,white foam with a 20 to 25 times increase in volume and NO foam collapse.Aerated Concrete,Lightweight Concrete,Cellular Concrete2019912&ensp&#0183&enspThe LITEBUILT&#174 Aerated Lightweight Concrete process is based on the principle of entrapping a multitude of air bubbles in the concrete mix,who retain their structure during the curing period.: Firstly,the mix composition of cement sand water foam according to specifiion has to be chosen.After batching the basic ingredients,LITEBUILT&#174 Foaming Agent is introduced to the mix

Foam concrete,the other type of cellular lightweight concrete,is produced with harmless foam,which is mixed into the slurry.A foaming agent is diluted with water and expanded with air within a foam generator and is then added into a cementitious slurry.Mix Design Cellular Concrete TechnologiesWhy is my concrete mix losing air while it mixes? Answer: Something is chewing up your air and destroying the concentrated air bubbles in the foam.Usually the cause of this would be manufactured sand or quartz sand.For this reason most of CCT mixes are washed concrete sand only and 3 8 rock.
