## How much does manganese cost
Do you mean manganese? If so,a &quot;greensand&quot; filter might work the cost was about $5000.00 around 10 years ago.It requires daily backwashing so you'd have to add the cost of the backwash water.Calculating reacting masses of reactants & products.divide by 184 to scale down to 1 tonne of copper ore reactant: 2000 x 1.0 = 2000 tonne ==> 2000 x 0.0.3478 = 695.6 tonne: then scale up by factor of 2000 for the initial 2000 tonne of ore: Therefore 695.6 tonne of copper can be extracted from 2000 tonne of chalcopyrite copper ore
