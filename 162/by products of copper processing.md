## Copper Smelting Process
Modern copper smelters use processed copper ore fed into a flash furnace,typically fired by oxygen which produces blister copper,being further processed in a converter furnace.Molten copper is poured from here into rectangular moulds,the resulting ingots subjected to electrolysis producing a metal of 99.9% purity.Copper can be recycled indefinitely without the base metal being compromised.From Ore to Finished ProductCopper Products &amp; Many Uses Copper cathodes are pure copper produced from the processing of copper ores.However,cathodes are not in the final form of usage as copper materials.9.Uses of Copper Copper has many uses because it is not only practical.
