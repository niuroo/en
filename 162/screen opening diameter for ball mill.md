## Calculate and Select Ball Mill Ball Size for Optimum Grinding
The ball sizing formulas from the literature on ball diameter selection do not take into consideration such as the target P90.Based on his work,this formula can be derived for ball diameter sizing and selection: Dm &lt;= 6 (log dk) * d^0.5 where D m = the diameter of the single sized balls in mm.d = the diameter of the largest chunks of ore in the mill feed in mm.Ball millA ball mill is a type of grinder used to grind,blend and sometimes for mixing of materials for use in mineral dressing processes,paints,pyrotechnics,ceramics and selective laser sintering.It works on the principle of impact and attrition: size reduction is done by impact as the balls drop from near the top of the shell.A ball mill consists of a hollow c
