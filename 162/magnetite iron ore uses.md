## Magnetite
Magnetite ore also allows scientists to better understand the history of Earth’s magnetic field.As igneous and sedimentary rocks that contain magnetite form,the iron within them is aligned with the Earth’s magnetic field at the time of formation (6).Magnetite UsesMagnetite is an excellent source of iron for the production of iron based chemicals like ferric chloride and ferric sulphate,that are used as alternatives to aluminum hydroxide.Aluminum hydroxide is used to help clarify raw water in municipal water purification plants,but concerns about aluminum in drinking water have prompted consideration of alternative chemicals.
