## Milling (machining)
Milling is a cutting process that uses a milling cutter to remove material from the surface of a work piece.The milling cutter is a rotary cutting tool,often with multiple cutting points.As opposed to drilling,where the tool is advanced along its rotation axis,the cutter in milling is usually moved perpendicular to its axis so that cutting occurs on the circumference of the cutter.Vertical Roller Mill，Working Principle Of Vertical Roller MillA vertical roller mill is a type of industrial equipment used to crush or grind materials into small particles.These machines consist of a large,heavy duty steel drum that relies on both hydraulic and pneumatic forces to pulverize rock or stone.
