## Gravity Gold &amp; Flotation Plant
This complete process plant is for recovering gold by gravity concentration and froth flotation.This commonly applies,but is not limited to,ore deposits containing GRG gold and sulphide minerals rich in gold (such as: Pyrite,Copper).This process will also recover silver associated with sulphide minerals.This simple metallurgical concentrator includes single stage crushing,…Unconventional column flotation of low grade gold fine.&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;The aim of this paper is to show results found combining HIC with the modified flotation,3PC,to recover valuable gold particles present in fresh tailings from copper gold flotation circuits.Flotation tailings,fresh or damped,are huge in many countries and recovery of these misplaced fine materials might be important economically.

## Sulphide Gold Ore Treatment by Leaching and Flotation Process
Problem with gold recovery from sulphide ore: How may a mill get the maximum recovery of gold from a sulphide ore,at the least capital cost and at the same time obtain the highest net return.This latter point is most important.In many cases a gold mill using an all cyanide flowsheet with fine grinding of all the ore will report very low gold content in the tailings particularly on an.Small Portable Gold Process PlantTailings from the flotation machines are fed to a #6 Concentrating Table to assure gravity recovery of any valuable mineral not amenable to flotation.Pan Filters are provided to de water concentrates.The Portable Mill shown is one of many possible arrangements
