## Chromite: The only mineral ore of chromium metal
Chromite is important because it is the only economic ore of chromium,an essential element for a wide variety of metal,chemical,and manufactured products.Many other minerals contain chromium,but none of them are found in deposits that can be economically mined to produce chromium.Sodium chromateThe process temperature is typically around 1100 C.For lab and small scale preparations a mixture of chromite ore,sodium hydroxide and sodium nitrate reacting at lower temperatures may be used (even 350 C in the corresponding potassium chromate system).
