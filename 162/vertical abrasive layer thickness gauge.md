## What is a Coating Thickness Gauge?
A coating thickness gauge (also referred to as a paint meter) is used to measure dry film thickness.Dry film thickness is probably the most critical measurement in the coatings industry because of its impact on the coating process,quality and cost.Dry film.Coating Thickness American Galvanizers Association&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;The electronic thickness gauge is operated by simply placing the magnetic probe onto the coated surface and then a digital readout displays the coating thickness.Electronic gauges have the advantage of not requiring recalibration with probe orientation,but do require verification with shims of different thicknesses in order to confirm the accuracy of the gauge at the time it is being used.
