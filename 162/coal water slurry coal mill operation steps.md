## Coal mining
Coal mining Coal mining Coal preparation: As explained above,during the formation of coal and subsequent geologic activities,a coal seam may acquire mineral matter,veins of clay,bands of rock,and igneous intrusions.In addition,during the process of mining,a portion of the roof and floor material may be taken along with the coal seam in order to create adequaPremium coal fuels with advanced coal beneficiationis much finer than the conventional coal water slurry fuel (CWSF) for boilers or gasifiers.CHEMICALLY CLEANED COAL Ultra clean coal can be produced by chemically cleaning coal,and a 2 and 3 stage caustic leach process has been successfully demonstrated in Australia by UCC Energy Pty Ltd.A significant feature of the process is that the coal.
