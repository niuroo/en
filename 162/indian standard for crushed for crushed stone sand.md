## Replacement of Natural Sand by Crushed Sand in the,
Jan 25,2017&#0183;&#32;Nowadays it is very important to make the concrete economical Therefore the present work has initiated to make the concrete economical by replacing the natural sand by crushed sand in the concrete From our study it is concluded that different Crushed sand gives different results for compressive strength depending on different quarries and from study of,EXPERIMENTAL STUDY ON STRENGTH OF CONCRETE USING,made with river bed sand Crushed pebbles cannot effectively be used in plain concrete in place of fine aggregate We can use crushed pebbles partially for the replacement of sand in concrete REFERENCES [1] IS: 8112 1989,Specifications for 43 grade ordinary Portland cement,Bureau of Indian standard,New Delhi
