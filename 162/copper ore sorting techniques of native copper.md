## Copper
Copper is one of the few metals that can occur in nature in a directly usable metallic form (native metals).This led to very early human use in several regions,from c.8000 BC.Thousands of years later,it was the first metal to be smelted from sulfide ores,c.5000 BC; the first metal to be cast into a shape in a mold,c.4000 BC; and the first metal to be purposefully alloyed with another.copper ore concentrate machine in south africaCopper Processing Equipment FEECO International,Inc.FEECO ore drums and conveyors are installed in some of the world''s largest and most.in processing many forms of copper,from copper ore to copper concentrates.Pug mills are a key piece of
