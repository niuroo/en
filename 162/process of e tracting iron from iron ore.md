## Process Of Extracting Iron From Iron Ore
The process of extracting iron from ore produces great quantities of poisonous and corrosive gases.In practice,these gases are scrubbed and recycled.Inevitably,however,some small amounts of toxic gases escape to the atmosphere.A byproduct of iron purification is slag,which is produced in huge amounts.IronIron ( ˈ aɪ ər n ) is a chemical element with symbol Fe (from Latin: ferrum) and atomic number 26.It is a metal that belongs to the first transition series and group 8 of the periodic table.It is by mass the most common element on Earth,forming much of Earth's outer and inner core.

## How is Iron Extracted from Iron Ore Actforlibraries.org
Meteorites that have fallen from space are the only iron found in nature in its pure form.Iron is found naturally in the form of ores that are oxides of the pure metal,such as hematite and magnetite.The most common of the modern methods used to extract iron from its ores is coke smelting in a blast furnace.Extraction of metals Iron WikiversityIron is extracted from its ore,haematite,by reduction with carbon.This takes place in a blast furnace (named after blasts of air [20% oxygen],heated to 1000 °C,which are blasted into the bottom of the furnace): A mixture of crushed iron ore,coke (an almost pure form of carbon) and limestone is fed into the top of the blast furnace.
