## Reading: Mineral Basics Geology
Halite is a mineral with the chemical formula NaCl,sodium chloride,in which the bonds between the atoms are all ionic bonds.Look at the diagram of halite showing the sodium and chloride ions arranged into the crystal lattice.MineralsMineral Formation Minerals are formed by solutions,melts,and vapors.As water evaporates,solid minerals precipitate out by solution (e.g.halite and gypsum).As molten magma crystallizes or water freezes to ice,minerals are formed by a melt (e.g.ice and.

Identifying minerals by physical properties The most common minerals in Earth's crust can often be identified in the field using basic physical properties such as color,shape,and hardness.The context of a mineral is important,too some minerals can form under the same conditions,so you are likely to find them in the same rock,while others form under very different conditions and will.Geology Cafe.comHalite is a very soft mineral because it's elements,sodium and chlorine are held together by ionic bonds (see info about chemical bonds in Chapter 2!) Sugar (C 6 H 12 O 6,sucrose) also forms crystals when precipitated from water,but because it is &quot;organic&quot; and therefore it is not a mineral.
