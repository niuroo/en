Ball mill.A typical type of fine grinder is the ball mill.A slightly inclined or horizontal rotating cylinder is partially filled with balls,usually stone or metal,which grind material to the necessary fineness by friction and impact with the tumbling balls.Ball mills normally operate with an apTest Method For Bond Ball Mill Work IndexNumerically,the work index is the energy required in kwht to reduce a given material from theoretically infinite feed size to 80 passing 100 micronshe work index of a particular material is determined in the laboratory by conducting the standard bond grindability test bond develo
