## PRECIPITATED CALCIUM CARBONATE Cimprogetti
Precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC),a manufactured form of calcium carbonate,is made by first hydrating high calcium quicklime,and then reacting the resulting slurry or "milk of lime" with carbon dioxide.The resulting product is extremely white and has a uniformly small particle size.It has numerous uses,most notably in the paper.Calcium Carbonate Market is projected to reach US$22,311.Commercially,calcium carbonate is available in two types,namely precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC) and ground calcium carbonate (GCC).PCC is produced as a result of reaction between carbon dioxide and a solution of calcium hydroxide,whereas GCC is obtained by crushing and processing limestone into calcium carbonate powder.The properties.

## Precipitated Calcium Carbonate (PCC) Minerals Tech
PCC stands for Precipitated Calcium Carbonate—also known as purified,refined or synthetic calcium carbonate.It has the same chemical formula as other types of calcium carbonate,such as limestone,marble and chalk: CaCO3.The calcium,carbon and oxygen atoms can arrange themselves in three different ways,to form three different calcium.PRECIPITATED CALCIUM CARBONATE MICRO PARTICLES PCC …For almost 25 years PCC Norway AS have helped the industry solving their challenges.In 2002 a study was accomplished* to verify if precipitated calcium carbonate micro particles were a more attractive cleaning agent for supragingival air polishing than standard sodium bicarbonate,which …
