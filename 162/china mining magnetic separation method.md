## We Mining Equipment,Magnetic Separation Process,Ore.
Magnetic Separation ProcessThis new type environmentally friendly magnetic separation process combines dry separation method and wet separation method.The process separate powdered ore to three classes and after that,the wet magnetic separation uses magnetic density of 400~1200GS.The magnetic drum rotation speed is 60~320 rpm.Magnetic Separation in the Mining IndustryMagnetic separation definitely is one of the most important parts of this process.I think magnetic separators are often taken for granted when it comes to processing,whether that processing is in mining or in food processing.
