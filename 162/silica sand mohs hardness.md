Jul 12,2011&#0183;&#32;In 1812 the Moh’s scale of mineral hardness was devised by the German mineralogist Frederich Mohs (1773 1839) He selected the ten minerals because they were common or readily available He selected the ten minerals because they were common or readily availableMaterial Hardness Tables,Ted Pella,IncHardness Tables Mohs Hardness Scale Hardnes Number Original Scale Modified Scale; 1 Talc Talc 2 Gypsum Gypsum 3,Orthoclase Orthoclase 7 Quartz Vitreous Silica 8 Topaz Quartz or Stellite 9 Corundum Topaz 10 Diamond Garnet 11,Fused Zirconia 12,Fused Alumina.

## Mohs hardness mineralogy Britannica
The Mohs hardness of a mineral is determined by observing whether its surface is scratched by a substance of known or defined hardness To give numerical values to this physical property,minerals are ranked along the Mohs scale,which is composed of 10 minerals that have been given arbitrary hardness,Silica Sand : Al Raddadi Trading EstSilica sand is used for golf course bunkers and greens as well as the construction of natural or synthetic athletic fields In golf and sports turf applications silica sand is the structural component of an inert,uncontaminated,growing media
