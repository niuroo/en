## Copper processing
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Copper processing Copper processing Roasting,smelting,and converting: Once a concentrate has been produced containing copper and other metals of value (such as gold and silver),the next step is to remove impurity elements.In older processes the concentrate,containing between 5 and 10 percent water,is first roasted in a cylindrical,refractory lined furnace of either the hearth or.Process Optimization in Copper ElectrorefiningCopper is one of the major metallic materials together with steel and aluminum.At present,approx.11 Mt of copper are produced all over the world by electrorefining in sulfuric acid electrolytes.In the last years the current density could be increased to 320 340 A m 2 by simultaneous improvement of the cathode quality,although the parameters “electrolyte” and “anode quality” did.

## Electrorefining
These have a pure copper cathode,on which copper is deposited (Eq.13.20),and a lead anode,rather than the copper anode used in electrorefining.The lead anode reforms sulfuric acid from the hydrogen ions released from water,instead of contributing dissolved lead to the electrolyte ( Eq.13.22 ).ElectrowinningElectrowinning is the oldest industrial electrolytic process.The English chemist Humphry Davy obtained sodium metal in elemental form for the first time in 1807 by the electrolysis of molten sodium hydroxide.Electrorefining of copper was first demonstrated
