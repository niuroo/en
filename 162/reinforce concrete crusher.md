## Reinforced Concrete Material Properties (Nonlinear)
The reinforced concrete material model is treated as statistically homogeneous with different tensile and compressive behaviors.It follows a “smeared” crack model where cracking and crushing are simulated via degeneration of the elasticity at integration points instead of tracking individual macroscopic cracks.Failure Modes of Concrete ColumnsThere are three modes of failure of concrete columns (compression members) i.e.failure due to pure compression,combined compression and elastic instability.These modes of failures of concrete compression members are discussed.Reinforced concrete column is a …
