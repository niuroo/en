## Chemistry of Copper
The extraction of copper also involves many steps.The ore used for extraction is copper pyrites,which is crushed,concentrated and then heated in the presence of air.During heating the moisture gets expelled and the copper pyrites gets converted to ferrous sulfide and cuprous sulfide.GCSE CHEMISTRY2017 3 27&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Extraction of Metals.Extraction of Copper.Copper is sometimes found as native metal.Copper ores include copper(II) oxide and copper(II) sulfide.Copper(II) oxide can be reduced by reaction with carbon.Some copper ores may contain only small amounts of copper.These are called low grade ores and have less than 1% copper but they are still used because copper is so valuable.

Your first equation is partially correct,there is a slight mistake.Copper is found in the +1 oxidation state or cuprous form in its ores,so the sulfide ore of copper known as copper glance has molecular formula of cuprous sulphide(Cu2S).Bec.Copper processingExtraction and refining The extraction of copper from ore is normally carried out in three major steps.The first step,mineral processing,is to liberate the copper minerals and remove waste constituents—such as alumina,limestone,pyrite,and silica—so that the copper minerals and other nonferrous minerals of value are concentrated into a product containing between 20 and 30 percent copper.
