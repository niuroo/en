## Crusher
A crusher is a machine designed to reduce large rocks into smaller rocks,gravel,or rock dust.Crushers may be used to reduce the size,or change the form,of waste materials so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled,or to reduce the size of a solid mix of raw materials (as in rock ore),so that pieces of different composition can be differentiated.Noise and Silica ExposuresThe companies evaluated were all small employers,with one to seven quarry operations employees working in three types of open surface mines.The three types of mines included two basalt excavation mines,three portable crusher operations,and five sand and gravel operations.The primary difference in the three operations is the source,size,
