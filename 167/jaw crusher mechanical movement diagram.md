## The effect of compression and sliding movement on the wear.
In a jaw crusher,a ﬂywheel is used to store kinetic energy to turn the eccentric axle,which applies the motion to the jaw.The amount of work consumed in each compression cycle depends on the movement pattern of the jaw as well as on the mechanical properties of the crushed mineral.Jaw Crusher Animation&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Engineered to be the highest capacity jaw crusher on the market,you can expect your Vanguard Plus jaw crusher to deliver up to 25% more tons per hour (TPH)

## Crusher
A jaw or toggle crusher consists of a set of vertical jaws,one jaw is kept stationary and is called a fixed jaw while the other jaw called a swing jaw,moves back and forth relative to it,by a cam or pitman mechanism,acting like a class II lever or a nutcracker.The volume or cavity between the two jaws is called the crushing chamber.Dynamic schematic diagram of crushing equipmentJaw crusher; Sand crusher machine; Impact crusher; Cone crusher; Gyratory Crusher; Mobile Crushing Plant.Track type Mobile Crushing Plant; Wheel Mobile Crushing Plant; Grinding Equipment.Hanging Roller Grind Mill; Ultrafine Grinding Mill; Vertical Grinding Mi
