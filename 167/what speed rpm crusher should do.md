## VSI crushers maximize first pass yields Pit &amp; Quarry
27 Apr 2016.VSI crushers maximize first pass yields,lower operating costs.All roads,you might say,lead to the vertical shaft impactor (VSI) because these crushers make it.Users can quickly change product size by changing rotor speed or cascade ratio.The high rpm and horsepower require careful “balance.Does RPM vary linearly with the speed of an airplane2020 4 18 ensp 0183 ensp So I assumed if a plane was flying at max RPM it would be flying at max speed too but saying if it flew at half the max speed it would be flying at half the max rpm sounded wrong Does it vary linearly or as a square root due to drag varying with velocity squared I just need an approximate model for my project so apologies if I trigger anyone with the lack of accuracy
