## Cone crushers
Cone crushers are equipped with a hydraulic setting adjustment system,which allows adjusting the crusher settings to fully match the material,feed size,and capacity requirements.Metso’s cone crusher offering consists of four different product families that utilize the same crushing principle but vary in featurea fracture toughness based model for the prediction of powercrushing experiments show that the capacity of a jaw crusher is dependent upon crushing process and the material characteristics related to fragmentation.

## Crusher
A crusher is a machine designed to reduce large rocks into smaller rocks,gravel,or rock dust.Crushers may be used to reduce the size,or change the form,of waste materials so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled,or to reduce the size of a solid mix of raw materials (as in rock ore),so that pieces of different composition can be differentiated.New Crusher Models Enhance Process Design Flexibility EManufacturers continue to make it easier to select the right combination of cost,capacity and power to satisfy any set of crusher circuit criteria.By Russell A.
