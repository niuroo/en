## Cone Crusher Working Principle Animation Engineering.
Cone crusher and gyratory crusher work on the same principle.Both have the same operation.If cone crusher differs then it is only from crushing chamber.Cone crusher has a less steep crushing chamber and more parallel zone between crushing zones.Crusher Bearings: Knowing the basics leads to better care&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;In a typical jaw crusher,two outer bearings located on either side of the main frame support an eccentric shaft,while two inner bearings support a moveable jaw.These are commonly known as “pitman” bearings.The reciprocating motion of the shaft moves the pitman against a second,stationary jaw.
