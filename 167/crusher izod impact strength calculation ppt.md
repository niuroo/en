## Determination of Impact Strength of Material (Charpy and Izod)
Izod and Charpy are impact strength measurement tests that produce a value that represents the amount of force an individual material can withstand.Both tests are widely used and accepted in product literature.If you need to convert an IzodIZOD Impact TestThe Izod Impact Test consists of a pendulum with a determined weight at the end of its arm swinging down and striking the specimen while it is held securely in a vertical position.Izod impact testing can be done up to 240 foot pounds on standard single notch and type X3 specimens…
