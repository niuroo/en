## Cone Crusher
The cone crusher is a modified gyratory crusher.The essential difference is that the shorter spindle of the cone crusher is not suspended,as in the gyratory,but is supported in a curved,universal bearing below the gyratory head or cone (Figure 8.2).Power is transmitted from the source to the countershaft to a V belt or direct drive.What is the eccentric throw? — Sandvik Mining and Rock.The eccentric throw is one of the most important parameters in defining the job that your cone crusher does.The mantle in a cone crusher spins in conical pendulum motion.That means it doesn’t stay in the center of the chamber it sweeps around moving closer and further away from the concave.This is what creates the crushing action.
