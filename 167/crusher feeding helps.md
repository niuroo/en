## Choke Feeding a Jaw Crusher What is Choke Feed Looks Like
Here is what a well choke fed jaw crusher looks like! Too many mines run these jaw crusher cavity like a funnel without any choking.Operators must keep the jaw’s cavity full to maximize rock on rock compression and crushing.Notice the shape of the liner profiles? A crusher is choke fed when the chamber is full and there is material above to keep it full.Crusher (Extra Utilities 2)The Crusher is added by Extra Utilities 2.This block is used to extract more materials than usual from most ore blocks,wool carpet blocks,ingots,flowers,and miscellaneous items.It acts sort of like a vanilla Furnace,but gives more resources when finished.The downside of the Crusher is that it takes 10 seconds (200 ticks) to process.
