## Crusher Wikipedia
A crusher is a machine designed to reduce large rocks into smaller rocks,gravel,sand or rock dust.Crushers may be used to reduce the size,or change the form,of waste.Crushers are used to reduce particle size enough so that the material can be.Gyratory crushers can be used for primary or secondary crushing.Crushing to 10 mesh with jaw crusher&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;While this may be true for a new crusher,this will quickly wear the plates and is a slow and inefficient way to crush.It is far better to use the jaw crusher for what they are inherently good at (crushing larger sizes) and use a secondary crusher for finer crushing and grinding (such as a cone crusher or roll crusher).
