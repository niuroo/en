## Shape,Size
Shape of three dimensional irregular bodies as coarse aggregate is difficult to describe; but is the vital property affecting the workability of fresh concrete and also its strength and durability.The characteristic of parent rock from which coarse aggregates have been produced and also the type of crusher used for crushing influence the shape.Shape Wise Classification of AggregatesShape of aggregates can get influenced by not only the characteristics of parent rocks but also by the type of crusher used to crush the rocks.Most of the jaw crushers with plain jaws will give flaky aggregate,while with footed jaws will give cubical ore.But it is the cone crusher whic

## Summary Aggregate Properties and the Performance of.
A number of factors can improve the shape of aggregate crushed in compression crushers: &#226; &#162; The crusher should be run with a full or choked feed cavity to promote inter particle crushing.&#226; &#162; Crushers should be operated in closed circuits where a recirculating feed can be used to ficrusher for cubical shape aggregatecubical shape aggregate plant Mining,Crushing &amp; Grinding Equipment “Our aggregates sells very well because of the cubical shape,nowadays more and more clients cares more about the aggregates shape,e.g.the airport proje
