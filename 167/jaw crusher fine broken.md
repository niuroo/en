## Crusher
The Blake crusher was patented by Eli Whitney Blake in 1858.The Blake type jaw crusher has a fixed feed area and a variable discharge area.Blake crushers are of two types single toggle and double toggle jaw crushers.In the single toggle jaw crushers,the swing jaw is suspended on the eccentric shaft which leads to a much more compact design.Jaw CrusherThe gyratory crusher can,just like a jaw crusher,accept boulder sizes close to 1.5 m (for the largest equipment). This crusher can handle products with a Mohs hardness that is not necessarily less than 5. As is the case for jaw crushers,there is not any mutual sliding on grinding surfaces,but simply rolling of the nut on concaves.
