## Crushing and Screening
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;How can we reduce the risk of plugging a crusher in the first place and make unplugging a crusher safer? Preventing plugging improves productivity and improves safety and there are simple ways to do this.For example: the tipping hydraulic grizzly is one of the simplest ways there is to prevent plugging on a jaw plant.Gyratory CrusherJaw crushers find a wide application for brittle materials.For example,they are used for comminution of porous copper cake.A Fritsch jaw crusher with maximal feed size 95 mm,final fineness (depends on gap setting) 0.3 15 mm,and maximal continuous throughput 250 Kg h is shown in Fig.2.8.

## Crushers
Jaw crushers.Jaw crushers are mainly used as primary crushers.Their main purpose is to reduce the material to a small enough size that it can be transported by conveyors to the next crushing stages.As the name suggest,jaw crushers reduce rock and other materials between a fixed and a moving jaw.Fixed Crusher is a stone crusher equipmentThe reasons why fixed crushers with these two kinds of capacities are popular among a large variety of choices could be illustrated in an example of a fixed jaw crusher which is usually taken as an ideal option for mining starters.Steady function.The rigid frame enables this kind of stonecrusher to work under strong pressure,and its jaw.
