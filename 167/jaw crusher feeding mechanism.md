A jaw or toggle crusher consists of a set of vertical jaws,one jaw is kept stationary and is called a fixed jaw while the other jaw called a swing jaw,moves back and forth relative to it,by a cam or pitman mechanism,acting like a class II lever or a nutcracker.The volume or cavity between the two jaws is called the crushing chamber.US2619150AUS2619150A US137780A US13778050A US2619150A US 2619150 A US2619150 A US 2619150A US 137780 A US137780 A US 137780A US 13778050 A US13778050 A US 13778050A US 2619150 A US2619150 A US 2619150A Authority US United States Prior art keywords chute jaw motor switch crushing mechanism Prior art date 1950 01 10 Legal status …
