## Copper Zinc Lead Separation Process
Copper Zinc Lead Separation Process The Cu Pb Zn separation process is among the most challenging flotation separations primarily because the first step must entail bulk flotation of the two most readily floatable minerals with these two minerals separated in a differential flotation …Flotation Process Mining Of ZincThe process is identical in principle to the flotation of other minerals.The figure on the right is a simplified version of a Pb Zn flotation circuit.The main difference in lead zinc flotation is that zinc is usually depressed while lead (and copper) is floated.The tailing from the lead flotation circuit is the feed to the zinc circuit.
