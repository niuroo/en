## Aluminium
Aluminium (aluminum in American and Canadian English) is a chemical element with the symbol Al and atomic number 13.It is a silvery white,soft,non magnetic and ductile metal in the boron group.By mass,aluminium makes up about 8% of the Earth's crust,it is the third most abundant element after oxygen and silicon and the most abundant metal in the crust,though it isAluminium alloyAluminium alloys with a wide range of properties are used in engineering structures.Alloy systems are classified by a number system or by names indicating their main alloying constituents (DIN and ISO).Selecting the right alloy for a given application entails considerations of its tensile strength,density,ductility,formability,workability,weldability,and corrosion resistance,to name a few.
