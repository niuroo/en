## Synthesis of zirconium nitride from zircon sand by.
Particle size distribution,as determined by laser scattering technique,showed that the particle size of zircon powder was in the range of 100 300 &#181;m.The nominal chemical composition of zircon sand was found to be 62% ZrO 2,35% SiO 2,1% Al 2 O 3,0.15 TiO 2 and 0.15% Fe 2 O 3.Here carbon powder was used mainly as a reducing agent to.Zirconium Powder Zirconium MetalZircon sand is also used as bricks in glass kilns.Zircon sand and powder are mixed with other refractory materials for other purposes.Zircon sand.Zirconium oxide.Zirconium and dolomite react together at high temperatures to produce zirconia or zirconium oxide (ZrO2).Zirconium oxide is also a good melting material,although its crystal.
