## An overview of reverse flotation process for coal.
Contrary to this,reverse flotation of coal in which coal particles are depressed and gangue particles floated,was developed as an alternative process to minimise the sulphur content in the coal.This method can also be applied to reduce the ash content of coal by floating the mineral matter present in coal.Mining Additional Mining Applications NouryonNouryon offers unique chemistries with the required functionalities for a wide range of mineral processing applications.Beyond flotation reagents,we offer various process aids like frothers,anti foaming agents,dewatering aids,extraction chemicals and anticaking agents.

## Revers Flotation Iron Ore Benification
Flotation is the most effective solution,both technologically and economically,when upgrading iron concentrates.Research regarding iron ore flotation began in 1931,demonstrating that reverse cationic flotation is a very efficient method for beneficiating oxidised iron ores.Reverse Flotation IntechOpenReverse flotation of coal can be explained as a process where valuable minerals are depressed,while undesired and unhealthy minerals are floated with the help of some reagents.Nowadays,conventional enrichment method of coal could not achieve removing unhealthy minerals partially from internal structure of coal such as sulfur,Hg,Au,which propagate in air after burning treatment,or heavy.
