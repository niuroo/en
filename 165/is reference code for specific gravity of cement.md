## Reference Is Code For Specific Gravity Of Cement
There is no specification for bulk specific gravity but it is used to calculate other specified parameters such as air voids VMA and VFA.Typical Values.Typical values for bulk specific gravity range from 2.200 to 2.500 depending upon the bulk specific gravity of the aggregate the asphalt binder content and the amount of compaction.Specific Gravity of Cement Detailed Explanation CivilologyIf the specific gravity of cement is greater than 319 then,the cement is either not minced finely as per the industry standard or it has more moisture content which will affect the mix and bonding This is why you find lots of chunks while,
