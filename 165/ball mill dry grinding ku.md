## Overflow VS Grate Discharge Ball or Mill
Grinding mills can by classified by which types of discharge the ball mill has installed to let out the ground slurry.Best is rapid change of mill content results in higher efficiency.Ball Mills have a very large discharge opening or area and smaller area for incoming feed.Ball MillingBall milling is suggested as a novel method for enhancing filler dispersion in different matrices that is environmentally and economically sustainable [85].It is a solid state mixing of powders,usually performed with ball mills,which enables intimate mixing of the constituents through repetitive plastic deformation.
