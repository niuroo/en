## Investigating the sustainability of the global silver.
Gold may take the role silver does in some electronics applications,but gold is expensive and becomes scarce at the same time or earlier than silver (Ragnarsdottir et al.2011,Sverdrup et al.2013c,Sverdrup and Ragnarsdottir,2014).The global gold production is 2500 tonne year and the global silver production from mines is an order of.Copper Mining and Extraction Sulfide OresCopper can be extracted from its ore by: Underground: sinking a vertical shaft into the Earth to an appropriate depth and driving horizontal tunnels into the ore.Open pit: 90% of ore is mined by this method.Ores near the surface can be quarried after removal of the surface layers.The ore is treated with dilute sulfuric acid.

## How Is Iron Extracted From the Earth? Reference.com
Iron ores in the form of hematite (ferrous oxide) and magnetite are removed from the earth through mining.The use of heavy mining equipment is necessary to dig out large pits in an area with a large deposit of iron ore; however,because iron does not occur naturally,it is necessary to use a blast furnace to separate or refine iron from the other substances in the iron ore.Gold Processing Methods &amp; Gold Ore Extraction18&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Of all the methods of extracting gold &amp; processing it from its ore,I used a few to evaluate two principal flowsheets in this case study.The flowsheets utilized operations that involved flotation,cyanidation and gravity concentration.Tests that mirror each of these unit operations were utilized to evaluate the principal flowsheets.This page offers a comparative review of gold recovery.
