&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Abstract.The mechanism of superconductivity in cuprates remains one of the big challenges of condensed matter physics.High T c cuprates crystallize into a layered perovskite structure featuring copper oxygen octahedral coordination.Due to the Jahn Teller effect in combination with the strong static Coulomb interaction,the octahedra in high T c cuprates are elongated along the c axis.How to Name Ionic CompoundsIonic compounds consist of cations (positive ions) and anions (negative ions).Ionic compound nomenclature or naming is based on the names of the component ions.In all cases,ionic compound naming gives the positively charged cation first,followed by the negatively charged anion.Here are the principal naming conventions for ionic compounds,along with examples to show how they are used:
