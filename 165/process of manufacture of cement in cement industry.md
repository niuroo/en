## Cement manufacturing
Cement manufacturing: components of a cement plant.This page and the linked pages below summarize the cement manufacturing process from the perspective of the individual components of a cement plant the kiln,the cement mill etc.For information on materials,including reactions in the kiln,see the ' Clinker ' …Cement &gt; About Cement &gt; Cement ManufactureCement is then pumped to silos for storage and dispatch.Mineral additions and SCMs are added to reduce the amount of clinker in cement.This in turn reduces the fuel,power,process emissions and raw materials associated with cement production.At the same time it creates a use for material considered to be a waste product of other industries.
