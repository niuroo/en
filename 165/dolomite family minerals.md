## Dolomite Meaning,Powers and History Birthstone Jewelry
Dolomite was named after the French mineralogist D Dolomieu (1750 1801) who first described the mineral in 1798 during a visit to Egypt with Napoleon Bonaparte Dolomite is composed of calcium and magnesium carbonate,and is quite similar to calcite There are a few different varieties of dolomiteDolomite as a nutritional supplement? Go Ask Alice!Dolomite,or calcium magnesium carbonate,is a common mineral extract that occurs as crystals in large rock beds of limestone Calcium carbonate is a cheap calcium supplement with a high percentage of calcium by weight,but the body has difficulty in breaking it down for use

## Calcium and igneous rocks
The problem is how to start with a bunch of igneous minerals which have silicon and end up with a sedimentary rock assemblage based on calcium.The minerals which make up the igneous rocks can't make calcite or dolomite directly,but they are a source of calcium (which is the main ingredient of both).Geology Chapter 3 Flashcards QuizletGeology Chapter 3 STUDY PLAY Building blocks of rocks Minerals,A family of high temperature silicate minerals Pyroxene,Carbonates,sulfates,and halid Two most common carbonate minerals Calcite and dolomite Limestone When calcite is the dominant rock in sedimentary rocks Dolostone When dolomite is the dominant rock

## The Limestone Carbonate Family of Rocks varieties
Transitions to dolomite are not common an examination of a large number of analyses shows that generally either the rock contains very little or no magnesia,or it has much and is a regular dolomite as described later.There are many varieties of limestone,depending on circumstances,especially the mode of formation.
