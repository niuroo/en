## Reserves
1&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The CIS,which as the USSR was the largest supplier of manganese ore at the beginning of the century,is now left with low grade ore reserves which have to be upgraded for commercial use.Only a limited amount of these reserves is exported,in quantities that are likely to decrease.10 Top Manganese producing Countries INNIndia is recognized as the 4th largest producer of Manganese ore in the world.The Manganese Ore Deposits of India are chiefly confined to pre cambrian rocks of peninsular India.Karnataka(36.6%) has the main share of reserves,while Orissa continues to be the leading producer of Manganese in India contributing about 36% of the total production.
