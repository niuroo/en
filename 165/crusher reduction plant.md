## What affects cone crusher performance? — Sandvik Mining.
Any fluctuation in pressure means that the optimal force will not be delivered consistently so,of course,crusher performance declines.These are the two main causes of sub optimal crushing performance,but losses in the reduction ratio can also be caused by selecting the wrong mantle or by having a poor chamber profile or design.CrushersThe disadvantage of this type of crusher,when high capacity is required,is the relatively small discharge width,limiting the capacity as compared with the discharge circuit of a gyratory crusher.Jaw crushers are mainly used in plants producing up to approximately 1600 t h.Primary crushing with gyratory crushers
