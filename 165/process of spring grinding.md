## How springs is made
4 Grinding.If the design calls for flat ends on the spring,the ends are ground at this stage of the manufacturing process.The spring is mounted in a jig to ensure the correct orientation during grinding,and it is held against a rotating abrasive wheel until the desired degree of flatness is obtained.Sophisticated spring and grinding machines WIREFor the manufacture of valve springs,injection springs and friction springs it is necessary to perform,due to assembling difficulties and mechanical functioning,a slight chamfer on the internal and or external spring edge in order to remove any burrs resulting from the grinding of the spring terminals (grinding process).
