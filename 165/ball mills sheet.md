## Optimization of mill performance by using
Optimization of mill performance by using online ball and pulp measurements by B.Clermont* and B.de Haas* Synopsis Ball mills are usually the largest consumers of energy within a mineral concentrator.Comminution is responsible for 50% of the total mineral processing cost.In today‚Ball MillThe ball mill is a tumbling mill that uses steel balls as the grinding media.The length of the cylindrical shell is usually 1 1.5 times the shell diameter (Figure 8.11).The feed can be dry,with less than 3% moisture to minimize ball coating,or slurry containing 20 40% water by weight.
