## Cesium : Wikis (The Full Wiki)
The mining of pollucite ore,as with other zoned pegmatites,is a selective process and is conducted on a small scale in comparison with most metal mining operations.The ore is crushed,hand sorted,but not usually concentrated,and then ground to prepare it for conversion to caesium metal or compounds.[2]KAl(SO4)2 + NaCl + H2O = ? : chemistryThe situation would be very different if NaCl was replaced with CsCl,CsAl(SO4)2.12H2O would precipitate because it is nearly insoluble in cold water,this trick is used for isolation of Cs from pollucite (the aluminosilicate ore is cooked with diluted sulfuric acid,upon slow cooling giant rhombs of Cs alum crystallize out of the supernatants)
