## Oxide Minerals Image Gallery and Descriptions
The oxide minerals are compounds of metallic elements plus oxygen,with two prominent exceptions: ice and quartz.Ice (H 2 O) always gets left out of the mineral books.Quartz (SiO 2) is treated as one of the silicate minerals.Some of them are primary minerals that solidify deep in the Earth in magmas,but the most common oxide minerals form near the surface where oxygen in the air and water.LNEGFrom 1988 to the end of 1995 the mine produced 8.7 Mt of copper ore,containing 790,000 tons of copper metal,and 2.2 Mt of tin ore,containing 41,140 tons of tin metal.Annual production currently stands at 1.9 Mt of copper and tin ore; plans to extend production to include zinc are being studied.

## Mining : definition of Mining and synonyms of Mining …
Mining is the extraction of valuable minerals or other geological materials from the earth,from an orebody,lode,vein,seam or reef,which forms the mineralized horizon and package of economic interest to the miner.To gain access to the mineralised package within the lease area (aka Mining Rights Lease) it is often necessary to mine through (to create access,shafts,addits,ramps) or.Mining24&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Inventions like the arrastra were often used by the Spanish to pulverize ore after being mined.This device was powered by animals and used the same principles used for grain threshing.[17] Much of the knowledge of medieval mining techniques comes from books such as Biringuccio’s De la pirotechnia and probably most importantly from Georg Agricola's De re metallica (1556).
