## Cyanide free gold recovery
The infrastructure for a processing plant that uses cyanidation typically costs $30 million,and is therefore,a barrier to entry for gold miners with smaller deposits that do not fit into the large scale economies of gold production.Gold recovery by cyanidation is also of environmental and safety concern as it relies on the use of toxic cyanide.Gold Mining Business Plan Sample TemplateGold mining operations range from tiny to gigantic Definitely,the location and size of the operation will determine how a miner will start a gold mine,You should store pure gold and highly concentrated gold ore in separate containers for further processing Actually,the processing of gold is the most time consuming task; eliminating all.

## Ore processing Waihi Gold
Ore processing is a 24 hour operation.Ore is stockpiled (1) at the processing plant,and the process begins by feeding the ore into a hopper with a loader.The ore is conveyed,and lime is added (2) to raise the pH of the ore.Production of Goldof high grade ore per year for 8 years The deposit contains 012 ounces of gold per ton of high grade ore and can be acquired at a cost of $10 per ton of ore (cost of mining ore at site) A sodium cyanide process is used to extract the gold from the ore,and various other processing techniques are used to produce 999% pure gold bullion from.
