## Solutions To Improve The Production Capacity Of Jaw …
Production capacity is the quantitative index to measure the processing ability of jaw crusher.The production capacity of jaw crusher directly affects the economic profits of investors.And the production capacity of jaw crusher is affected by many factors,such as the properties of raw material (hardness,size,and bulk density),type&amp; size of jaw crusher,operation condition of jaw crusher and so on.CrusherMore reliability and higher production have been added to basic cone crusher designs that have also remained largely unchanged.Increases in rotating speed have provided the largest variation.For instance,a 48 inch (120 cm) cone crusher manufactured in 1960 may be able to produce 170 tons h of crushed rock,whereas the same size crusher manufactured today may produce 300 tons h.
