## Optimization of mill performance by using
charge motion.It is well known that ball milling efficiency varies during the lifetime of the shell liner.For instance,the mill performance could become worse or better by putting in a new shell liner.Data from pilot plant test work illustrates the influence of the shell lifting effect on the grind for a primary …Operating Principle of Ball MillsIt is the most efficient type of grinding and mixing as it ensures that the entire material is shuffled.The three different modes of ball mills make them the essential equipment for a number of industries that deal with the extraction of minerals,synthesis of new compounds,and for processing of raw natural resources.

## Cement grinding Vertical roller mills versus ball mills
grinding of raw materials.The grinding efficiency of the vertical roller mill combined with an ability to dry,grind and classify within a single unit gives the vertical roller mill a decided advantage over a ball mill system.However,Mill (grinding)SAG is an acronym for semi autogenous grinding.SAG mills are autogenous mills that also use grinding balls like a ball mill.A SAG mill is usually a primary or first stage grinder.SAG mills use a ball charge of 8 to 21%.The largest SAG mill is 42' (12.8m) in diameter,powered

## ball mills primary grinding
Ball mills are used primary for single stage fine grinding,regrinding,and as the second stage in two stage grinding circuits.According to the need of customers,ball mill can be either wet or dry designs.These mills are sized from 2 t h to 30 TPH for wet grinding and from t h to 30 TPH for dry grinding.Ball MillsAlthough rod mill installations are thus restricted in normal practice to the coarse crushing of soft and friable ores,it is sometimes found that the most economical method of grinding an ore of not more than average hardness is to use a rod mill in the primary and a ball mill in the secondary stage.
