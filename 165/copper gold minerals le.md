## Minerals Metals
29&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Metals constitute a large portion of the Periodic Table of elements.Their combinations with each other and the other elements result in the minerals that compose rocky objects.Generally,the transition metals constitute the periodic table of elements from groups 12,beginning with scandium (Sc) and ending with element number 112 Copernicium.Usually,these and the other metals are.Copper Geoscience Australia5&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The ore is then ground finely before the copper bearing sulphide minerals are concentrated by a flotation process that separates the grains of ore mineral from the gangue (waste material).Depending on the type of copper bearing minerals in the ore and the treatment processes used,the concentrate can contain between 25 and 57% copper.
