## Using modified strong copper extractants to treat …
This article summarizes the evolution of modified strong copper extractants,focusing on the fairly recent requirement to effectively extract copper from high concentration aqueous feeds derived from the hydrometallurgical processing of sulfidic copper ores.Copper mines and chemistry News Chemistry WorldThe process uses sulfuric acid to make copper sulfate,which is purified by a solvent extraction process before electrolysis produces pure copper.Products from each of these steps can feed the others so theoretically the overall process consumes only electricity.But impure sulfidic ores have always posed problems for this process.
