## How Cement Is Made
Cement is so fine that 1 pound of cement contains 150 billion grains.The cement is now ready for transport to ready mix concrete companies to be used in a variety of construction projects.Although the dry process is the most modern and popular way to manufacture cement,some kilns in the United States use a wet process.Cement ProductionCement Production.Cement production is an energy intensive industrial process that requires heat to be supplied at high temperature levels under the constraints of gas solid heat exchange phenomena and the kinetics of chemical reactions.
