## Mill (grinding)
Ball mill.A typical type of fine grinder is the ball mill.A slightly inclined or horizontal rotating cylinder is partially filled with balls,usually stone or metal,which grind material to the necessary fineness by friction and impact with the tumbling balls.Ball mills normally operate with an apBall Mills vs Rod MillsRod Mills = Selective Grinding.Ball Mills = Non Selective Grinding.Large Balls &amp; Small Rods Compared.Is it better to use a grinding mill with large balls or will small rods? How do you decide between using a ball mill or a rod mill? Many investigators have attributed the selective grinding of rods to line contact.Other things should be.

## Mining Industry: What is the difference of ball mill.
Most mills used in mining rely on impact to breakdown rock to a suitable size for downstream processing.The impact can be rock on rock such as in an Autogenous Grinding (AG) mill,Laboratory Ball Mills,Planetary Ball Mill,High Energy.The interplay between these forces produces the high and very effective degree of size reduction of the planetary ball mill.Across International gear drive 4 station planetary ball mills have built in,reverse and timing functions.Hi
