## Process description
2&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Dissolved air flotation (DAF) is a water treatment process that clarifies wastewaters (or other waters) by the removal of suspended matter such as oil or solids.The removal is achieved by dissolving air in the water or wastewater under pressure and then releasing the air at atmospheric pressure in a flotation tank basin.The released air forms tiny bubbles which adhere to the suspended matter.Dissolved Air Flotation Theory14&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Dissolved Air Flotation (DAF) is the process of removing suspended solids,oils and other contaminants via the use of air bubble flotation.Air is dissolved into water,mixed with the wastestream and released from solution while in intimate contact with the contaminants.
