## Cement mill
10&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The efficiency of the early stages of grinding in a ball mill is much greater than that for formation of ultra fine particles,so ball mills operate most efficiently by making a coarse product,the fine fractions of this then being separated,and the coarse part being returned to the mill inlet.CE Materialsthe length of time from the initial contact between the cement grains and water until the cement paste gains sufficient strength to prevent impressions when the cement is walked on (concrete is hard enough to do some light work on it e.g.sawing joints)
