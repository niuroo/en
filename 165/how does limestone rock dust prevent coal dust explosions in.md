How Does Limestone Rock Dust Prevent Coal Dust … Coal dust explosions in underground coal mines are pre&#173; vented by a generous application of rock dust (usually lime&#173; stone).If an explosion should occur,the rock dust disperses,mixes with the coal dust and prevents ﬂ ame propagation by acting as a thermal inhibitor or heat sink.CiteSeerXCiteSeerX Document Details (Isaac Councill,Lee Giles,Pradeep Teregowda): How does limestone rock dust prevent coal dust explosions in coal mines?
