## Construction aggregate Wikipedia
Construction aggregate,or simply "aggregate",is a broad category of coarse to medium grained particulate material used in construction,including sand,gravel,crushed stone,slag,recycled concrete and geosynthetic aggregat Aggregates are the most mined materials in the worldWaste Materials in Concrete Technology: Sustainability and,to concrete technology developments,particularly connected to advances in concrete admixtures,mineral additions are used quite frequently in concrete today In fact,many by products and solid recyclable materials can be used in concrete mixtures as aggregates or cement replacement.

## New Construction Materials for Modern Projects
Concrete grades up to M80 are now being used for highrise buildings in India However,due to escalation in the repair and replacement costs,more attention is now being paid to durability issu There are compelling reasons why the concrete construction practice during the next decades should be driven by durability in addition to strengthCONCRETE TECHNOLOGY authorSTREAMConcrete Mix Design: Concrete Mix Design For a concrete technologist,he should have a minimum knowledge about CMD CMD can be defined as process of selecting suitable ingredients of concrete and determining their relative proportions with object of producing concrete of certain minimum strength and durability as economically as possible
