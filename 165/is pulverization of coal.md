## What is the need for coal pulverization?
Q: What is the need for coal pulverization? A: The smaller the particle size the more surface area will be exposed to oxygen and so be combusted completely.This means greater efficiency due to lower carbon losses in the ash.pulverization of coalpulverization of coal.enclosed chamber with wear resistant plates.The hammers impact on the coal,crushing it against the plates.Further pulverization is achieved as the smaller coal.Read More.Activated Carbon Filtration.By Frank DeSilva.Published in Water Quality Products Magazine,January,2000.
