## Copper Ore Processing Methods
18&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The four major steps in the production of marketable copper are mining,concentrating,smelting,and refining.In a few instances,however,leaching takes the place of concentrating,smelting,and refining.At present,although considerable leaching and direct smelting ores are produced,the bulk of the copper ore mined is concentrated.The milling of copper ores as practiced in the larger.What Is Copper Smelting? (with pictures)15&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Copper smelting is the process of separating copper metal from the rock in which it is naturally embedded by melting it.This is accomplished through a series of several processing steps.The term copper smelting may refer to this melting step in particular or it may refer somewhat less formally to the entire process overall.
