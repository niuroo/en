## Mineral profile: Lithium
A new mineral discovered in Serbia in 2007,jadarite is a monoclinic,white borosilicate mineral with a hardness of 4 to 5 on Mohs scale and a density of 2.45 kg m (Stanley et al,2007).It is not currently extracted for lithium but has the potential to be a significant source in …Barite Mineral Uses and PropertiesGive students several white mineral specimens that are about the same size (we suggest calcite,quartz,barite,talc,gypsum).Students should be able to easily identify barite using the &quot;heft test&quot; (placing Specimen &quot;A&quot; in their right hand and Specimen &quot;B&quot; in their left hand and &quot;hefting&quot; the specimens to determine which one is heaviest).
