## Types of Grinding Machine
The grinding is a simple process in which very small size of chips are remove from work piece by rubbing action of an abrasive material.But at different condition according to the working environment,different types of grinding machines is used.abrasive machining processes5&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Difference between grinding and milling The abrasive grains in the wheel are much smaller and more numerous than the teeth on a milling cutter.Cutting speeds in grinding are much higher than in milling.The abrasive grits in a grinding wheel are randomly oriented.A grinding wheel is self sharpening.

## Machining
Machining is a term used to describe a variety of material removal processes in which a cutting tool removes unwanted material from a workpiece to produce the desired shape.The workpiece is typically cut from a larger piece of stock,which is available in a variety of standard shapes,such as flat sheets,solid bars,hollow tubes,and shaped beams.Grinding ProcessGrinding is defined as machining with geometrically undefined cutting edges.Advantages of grinding over other machining methods: &#187; Good machining of tough materials &#187; High degree of dimensional and geometric accuracy &#187; Defined surface finish manufactures high quality grinding tools for virtually all grinding processes.
