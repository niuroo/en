## Purification process of natural graphite as anode for Li.
The intercalation of Li ions in natural graphite that was purified by chemical and thermal processes was investigated.A new chemical process was developed that involved a mixed aqueous solution containing 30% H 2 SO 4 and 30% NH x F y heated to 90 &#176;C.The results of this process are compared to those obtained by heating the natural graphite from 1500 to 2400 &#176;C in an inert environment.Synthetic graphite is purer but the future belongs to.Synthetic graphite is very expensive to produce,deriving from petroleum coke and costing up to 10 times as much as the best natural graphite.But the game could turn in the next few years in favor of natural graphite because battery manufacturers are interested in increasing the proportion of natural graphite used in batteries to lower their.
