## Bauxite Enrichment by Microwave Magnetising …
As high grade bauxite is getting depleted in several parts of the world,bauxite with high iron content is becoming increasingly important,and this trend has called for studies into the reduction of iron in bauxite.This study investigated the use of microwave energy in the magnetising roasting of high iron bauxite using sawdust as reducing agent.Pre beneficiation of Low Grade Diasporic Bauxite Ore by Reduction.Keywords—Low grade diasporic bauxite,magnetic separation,reduction.Rutile (TiO2),which is a valuable mineral,is also present in the bauxite ores.
