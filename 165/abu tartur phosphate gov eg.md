Seeking ways to diminish Egypt’s dependency on foreign oil imports,we had to look for the obvious resources to exploit Oil shale is one of Egypt’s resources that are left abandoned and not used This project is aiming at introducing both experimental analysis for oil shale in Egypt and the best production technique for it This study is about experimentally analyzing different samples of.Forms of Iron in the Phosphorites of Abu Tartur Area,Egyptphosphate resources in Egypt alone exceed 3 billion metric tons (Notholt,1985) Two third of these three billions occur only in the Abu Tartur area (Glenn and Arthur,1990) Iron rich Neogene phosphorite nodules occur on a number of present day continental shelves including the Agulhas Bank,South Africa (Parker,1975; Parker and Siesser,1972.
