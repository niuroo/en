## Calculate and Select Ball Mill Ball Size for Optimum Grinding
In Grinding,selecting (calculate) the correct or optimum ball size that allows for the best and optimum ideal or target grind size to be achieved by your ball mill is an important thing for a Mineral Processing Engineer AKA Metallurgist to do.Often,the ball used in ball mills is oversize “just in case”.Well,this safety factor can cost you much in recovery and or mill liner wear and tear.Drawing (manufacturing)Drawing is a metalworking process which uses tensile forces to stretch metal or glass.As the metal is drawn (pulled),it stretches thinner,into a desired shape and thickness.Drawing is classified in two types: sheet metal drawing and wire,bar,and tube drawing.The specific definition for sheet metal drawing is that it involves pl
