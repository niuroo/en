## Compressive strength Wikipedia
Compressive strength or compression strength is the capacity of a material or structure to withstand loads tending to reduce size,as opposed to tensile strength,which withstands loads tending to elongateIn other words,compressive strength resists compression (being pushed together),whereas tensile strength resists tension (being pulled apart) In the study of strength of materials.ASTM Test Results Select StoneCompressive Strength Compressive Strength is the stress,in pounds per square inch (psi) that will rupture a stone sample Very rarely is the compressive strength of a stone much of a factor in stone selection A column of stone with a density of 160 lbs cf that is 100 feet tall exerts a compressive stress of only 110 pounds per square inch
