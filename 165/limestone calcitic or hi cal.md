## Dolomitic vs calcitic lime LawnSite
&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Calcitic and dolomitic lime are two types of regular old limestone.One has more calcium,the other more magnesium.Both come in pelletized or powder form.Both work at roughly the same speed.Depends on what your soil needs.I prefer calcitic,as I find most soils need more calcium.Solucal,and it's knock offs,are faster acting products.Pro Pelleted Calcitic LimestonePro Select Prill (87% CaCO3,7% MgCO3).Cal Carb Equivalent 95.8%.The most common and most frequently used soil conditioner.Calcitic is the fancy name of the product we used to call Hi Cal lime.Its recommended for soils with excess magnesium: contains just 1 6 the amount of magnesium carbonate as dolomitic lime.With less than 5% magnesium oxide,it's recommended for soils with excess.

## Should I use dolomitic or calcitic lime?
In some areas,the local and most economical source of agricultural lime is from a dolomitic limestone quarry.Calcitic lime may need to be trucked a longer distance,or vice versa.Either way,one source of lime may be cheaper than the other.In this case,it may have been applied repeatedly over many years.Dolomite Lime How Garden Lime Can Cause Problems19&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Dolomite limestone is used to counteract this,to “sweeten” the soil.It can do that,but that doesn’t mean it’s always a good thing.First of all,minerals may or may not be leaching from your soil.If they are,it could be partially because of rain,but there are other reasons,too.
