## Behaviour of Volatile Materials in Cement Kiln Systems.
Abstract.Factors governing behaviour of minor amounts of Cl,K,Na and S in cement production kilns are reviewed.Recirculating loads form as a result of partial volatilisation in the burning zone and are often implicated in formation of build ups,coating and blockages in cooler parts of the process.What Is Specific Gravity Cement Why We Calculate.What Is Specific Gravity Cement? Specific gravity is generally defined as the ratio between the mass of a given volume of material and mass of an equal volume of water.One of the methods of determining the specific gravity of cement is by the use of a liquid such as water free kerosene,which does not […]
