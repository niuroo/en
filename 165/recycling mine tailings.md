When rain falls on tailings,it leaches away materials that can create water pollution,for example,lead,arsenic,and mercury.Sulfuric acid is sometimes produced when water interacts with tailings,or it can be a by product of ore processing.As a result,highly acidic water leaks from the tailings and disrupts aquatic life downstream.Mining EnviroServOther factors to take into consideration are the overburden,slags,water treatment sludge,tailings,and gaseous waste.The overburden,usually piled on site for cost effectiveness,should ideally be used for recontouring and revegetation when the mine is closed.Rather than being discarded,slags can be profitably&nbsp;.
