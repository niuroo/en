## Manufacturing Light Concrete with PET Aggregate
The manufacture of concrete using a polymer instead of a stony coarse aggregate known as gravel is presented.Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is the polymer used,recycling soft drink containers with sufficient tenacity.PET is a material commonly used by engineers as a structural element,not as an aggregate.The research work revealed that PET aggregate produces good quality mixtures with.Resource recovery as alternative fuel and raw material.4&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;In the aluminum industry,spent pot lining (SPL) is a waste product generated at a rate of 1 1.5 MTPA and is an environmental burden.Experimental studies and mathematical modeling supports the possibilities for using SPL as an alternative fuel to coal in an iron melting blast furnace (Yu et al.2017).Handling scrap tires is a burdensome.
