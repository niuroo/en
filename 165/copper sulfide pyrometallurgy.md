## Phase equilibria in the pyrometallurgy of sulfide ores.
Although reaction kinetics and process dynamics may greatly affect the engineering of pyrometallurgical processes,the limits of what can be achieved are set by the equilibrium relations.After a discussion of some experimental techniques this lecture reviews the phase equilibria that are of importance for the roasting and smelting of some important sulfide ores.The quaternary systems Zn Fe S.From Ore to Finished Product1&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Copper From Beginning to End.Copper is a major metal and an essential element used by man.It is found in ore deposits around the world.It is also the oldest metal known to man and was first discovered and used about 10,000 years ago.And as alloyed in bronze (copper tin alloy) about 3000 BC,was the first engineering material known to man.
