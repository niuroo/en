## Copper Alloys
While Bi and Se,as substitutes for lead,provide machinability properties similar to lead in the copper alloys,the cost,toxicity,and availability of Bi and Se as viable substitutes for lead remain questionable.In view of this,graphite particles have been dispersed in the matrix of cast copper alloys as substitutes for lead.Lead CopperLead is added to many copper alloys to make all types of free machining alloys.Lead does not affect the structure and properties of copper because it is practically insoluble in solid copper.Lead coppers are categorized as low lead alloys,or free machining alloys and high lead alloys.
