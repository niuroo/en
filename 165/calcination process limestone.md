## Calcination
The IUPAC defines calcination as &quot;heating to high temperatures in air or oxygen&quot;.However,calcination is also used to mean a thermal treatment process in the absence or limited supply of air or oxygen applied to ores and other solid materials to bring about a thermal decomposition.A calciner is a steel cylinder that rotates inside a heated furnace and performs indirect high temperature.Calcination30&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;In limestone calcination,a decomposition process,the chemical reaction is.CaCO 3 → CaO + CO 2 (g).The standard Gibbs free energy of reaction is approximated as ΔG&#176; r = 177,100 − 158 T (J mol).[4] The standard free energy of reaction is 0 in this case when the temperature,T,is equal to 1121 K,or 848 &#176;C.Oxidation
