## Limestone gypsum FGD
Wet flue gas desulphurisation is usually based on the use of calcareous absorbents (for example limestone,calcium hydrate,quicklime or chalk).Industrially,the use of limestone as an absorbent has prevailed in the area of power stations.The limestone gypsum method produces gypsum as an end product,which is marketable for industrial re use.Wet Flue Gas Desulfurization with Lime Limestone SlurryIn wet flue gas desulphurisation,open spray tower absorbers have prevailed which are divided into two principal zones.These are the absorption zone exposed to the flue gas and the absorber sump,in which the limestone slurry is trapped and collected.
