## Breccia
Impact breccia,a type of impactite,forms during the process of impact cratering when large meteorites or comets impact with the Earth or other rocky planets or asteroids.Breccia of this type may be present on or beneath the floor of the crater,in the rim,or in the ejecta expelled beyond the crater.Fault breccia28&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Fault breccia ( ˈ b r ɛ tʃ i ə or ˈ b r ɛ ʃ i ə ; Italian for &quot;breach&quot;),or tectonic breccia,is a breccia (a rock type consisting of angular clasts) that was formed by tectonic forces.Fault breccia is a tectonite formed by localized zone of brittle deformation (a fault zone) in a rock.

## Two Stage SAG Grinding Circuits VS ABC Circuits
2&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Grinding facilities are arranged either as single stage circuits,or in a two stage configuration with ball mills.Another major concentrator,designed with an autogenous mill,ball mill,crusher (ABC circuit),is presently under construction and scheduled for start up late this year.The host rock of the Island Copper deposit is a highly fractured fine grained andesite.A prominent alteration.《（） 》！Good fluid transportation performance zones are the extension fracture zone adjacent to the tectonite breccia zone and the breccia zone formed at the early evolutionary stage.The typical compression fault structure consists of a boulder clay zone or zones of grinding gravel rock,compression foliation,tectonite lens,and dense fracture development.

Good fluid transportation performance zones are the extension fracture zone adjacent to the tectonite breccia zone and the breccia zone formed at the early evolutionary stage.The typical compression fault structure consists of a boulder clay zone or zones of grinding gravel rock,compression foliation,tectonite lens,and dense fracture development.BrecciaBreccia is commonly used for clastic sedimentary rocks composed of large sharp angled fragments embedded in a fine grained matrix of smaller particles or mineral cement.The breccia generated by folding,faulting,magmatic intrusions,and similar forces is called tectonic breccia.The tectonic breccia zones are represented by crush,rubble,crackle,and shatter rock mass.
