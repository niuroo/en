The cone crusher is therefore an excellent arrested crusher.The flare of the bowl allows a much greater head angle than in the gyratory crusher,while retaining the same angle between the crushing members.This gives the cone crusher a high capacity,since the capacity of gyratory crushers is roughly proportional toCrusherAs for VSC series cone crusher,there are four crushing cavities (coarse,medium,fine and superfine) to choose.Compared with the same type,VSC series cone crusher,whose combination of crushing frequency and eccentricity is the best,can make materials have higher comminution degree and higher yield.
