## Cement required for m20?
The Question is mistake.The Question is How much sand and aggregate required for the one cubic meter of M20 grade concrete? Answer : 20mm aggregate = 0.90M3 Sand = …cement required for m25 concrete&#183; Hence 11 bags of cement are required for preparing 1cu.m of M25 concrete.Admixtures(like plasticisers,super plasticisers) are usually added to increase workability of the mix at lower water cement ratio.So,I don't think addition of admixture would change the quantity of cement.
