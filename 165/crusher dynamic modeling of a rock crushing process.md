## Crusher
A crusher is a machine designed to reduce large rocks into smaller rocks,gravel,or rock dust.Crushers may be used to reduce the size,or change the form,of waste materials so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled,or to reduce the size of a solid mix of raw materials (as in rock ore),so that pieces of different composition cEnergy Efficiency Opportunities in the Stone androck.Optimizing blasts to yield smaller rocks would reduce crusher plant energy crushing operations are dynamic,the simulation is set to model a typical day&#39;s

## Comparison between bond crushing energy and fracture.
PFC3D model of rock and jaw crusher In order to examine the fracture behaviour of the rocks and to determine the applied energy in a jaw crusher,a PFC3D model of a jaw crusher was developed.This model is a single macro particle simulation in a crusher,and manalysis of energy consumption of crushing processeswas carried on a model double toggle jaw crusher which allows crushing forces,materials energy consumption in the two stage crushing process was reduced by 30%.Key words: rock crushing,jaw crusher,crushing efficiency,two stage crushing process.1.Model of Jaw Crusher,Machine Dynamics Research,2015.
