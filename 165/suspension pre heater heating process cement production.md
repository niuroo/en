## CHAPTER 3.0 CEMENT MANUFACTURING PROCESS
3&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;3.1 Manufacturing Process The cement manufacturing process consist of the following multi stages as.Secondary Crusher (Impactor) for further size production.The crushed limestone is.The clinkerisation section consists of a 4 to 7 stages of Suspension Preheater Pre calcinator and a Rotary Kiln.Generally used 4 stage suspension PreheaterCookshangoutThe new cement kilns use the dry process.In this type of kiln,the raw material is blended and entered into the kiln from a pre heater tower.Hot gases from the kiln and the cooled clinker are used for heating the raw materials.The dry process is more efficient than the wet process of manufacturing cement.
