## Differences between Hydrated lime and quicklime …
The main differences between hydrated lime and quicklime are their reactivity &amp; their chemical composition.Hydrated lime and quicklime are both calcium compounds.In its hydrated state,calcium is called calcium hydroxide,and in its pure state it is called calcium oxide,or quicklime.Calcium oxide has a heavy density (65lb ft&#179;) and is more reactive than hydrated lime.Bulk Material Density Guide HapmanYou need to know bulk density to work with any powder or bulk solid.This guide listing thousands of materials is meant as a reference tool to assist you in designing your production system.Because the bulk density of a substance varies greatly depending on how the material has been handled,the information contained in this reference tool.

## Hydrated Lime
23&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Experienced handlers of hydrated lime have observed that no two samples are exactly alike.On average,hydrated lime has a bulk density of 40 lb ft 3 and is a soft and somewhat sluggish powder that has a tendency to pack or smear.In some cases however,the hydrated lime will do neither,but may instead contain abrasive crystals.Particle size and plasticity of lime14&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Bishop] Particle Size and Plasticity oj Lime 287 diameters,the !&gt;eometric standard deviation,&quot; and the specific smfaces that for each hme the diameter distribution of the particles smaller than 2 microns was represented by an extrapolation of the straight line fitted to the observed points for particles greater than 2 microns.
