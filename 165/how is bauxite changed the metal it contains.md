Aluminum foil is made from an aluminum alloy which contains between 92 and 99 percent aluminum Usually between 000017 and 00059 inches thick,foil is produced in many widths and strengths for literally hundreds of applications It is used to manufacture thermal insulation for the construction.Changes in distribution and microstructure of bauxite.Organic carbon may act as an important binding agent in aggregate formation whilst polyvalent metal ions form bridges between clay minerals and organic molecules.Based on the unique properties of bauxite residue,decreasing pH and salinity and increasing organic carbon may be effective strategies to improve aggregate formation.

## Australian Bauxite The Australian Aluminium Council
There are currently five bauxite mines in Australia providing feedstock for the seven alumina refineries,which in turn supply alumina to the six Australian aluminium smelters and the export market.Australia is the largest producer of bauxite in the world,with 74.9 million tonnes produced in 2011.How aluminium is producedHOW ALUMINIUM IS PRODUCED.Bauxite is a mineral made up primarily of aluminium oxide mixed with some other minerals.Bauxite is regarded as high quality if it contains more than 50% of aluminium oxide.At this stage the metal still contains a lot of iron,silicon,copper and other elements.
