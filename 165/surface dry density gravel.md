## Soil Moisture Content Dry Density Relationship
19&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The soil with maximum dry density is suitable for the several constructional purposes.But maximum dry density of soil through compaction will be possible at a particular moisture content called optimum moisture content.Hence compaction purely depends upon the relationship between moisture content of soil and its dry density which is briefly.Dry DensityFor coarse grained soils with an existing dry density lower than the maximum dry density,vibrations will result in the rearrangement of the soil grains.The result is a reduction in void ratio and compressibility,as well as an increase in the internal angle of friction (Van Impe et al.1997).Vibro compaction is the use of a depth vibrator to subject the ground to such vibrations resulting.
