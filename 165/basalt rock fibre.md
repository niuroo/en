## Basalt Fibre
Basalt fibre grids embedded in cement based mortar have been used as external confinement of concrete cylinders (Di Ludovico et al.2010).The application required the patching of a layer of cement based mortar with a thickness higher than 4 mm.Then the bidirectional basalt fibre grid was preimpregnated with epoxy resin or latex.Basalt fiber WikipediaThe Basalt Fiber History From a volcanic lava to an advanced composite From Lava to Rock Basalt is a type of igneous rock formed by the rapid cooling of lava at the surface of a planet
