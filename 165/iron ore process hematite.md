Uses of Hematite (Iron Ore) Hematite is the world’s most important ore of iron.Although magnetite contains a higher percentage of iron and is easier to process,hematite is the leading ore because it is more abundant and present in deposits in many parts of the world.Hematite is mined in some of the largest mines in the world.Building A New Industry Citic Pacific MiningAs opposed to hematite iron ore that is traditionally mined in Western Australia,the project mines magnetite iron ore.Magnetite requires beneficiation before it can be exported for use in the steel making process and is a desirable and high quality product for steel mills.Process Comparison.Magnetite and Hematite&nbsp;.
