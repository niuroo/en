## Top 12 Sulphur Exporting Countries
Top 12 Sulphur Exporting Countries.The Claus process was developed in the 1880's by chemist Carl Friedrich Claus and is now the standard process used to extract sulfur since it is now commonplace to extract sulfur via petroleum and gas sources.Processing.Why is sulfur used for making gunpowder?Black “gun” powder is approximately 75% potassium nitrate,15% wood charcoal,and 10% sulfur,by mass.The charcoal is the main fuel,and the potassium nitrate is the oxidizer.Sulfur is an additional fuel.The main reason that sulfur is included.
