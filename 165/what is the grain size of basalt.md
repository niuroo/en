Mare basalts with the most negative δ 66 Zn (&lt; − 1 ‰) are medium to fine grained,but otherwise there is no relationship of grain size with mare basalt δ 66 Zn values.Nor do the Zn isotope compositions track changes with magmatic differentiation.What Is the Grain Size of Granite? ReferenceGranite typically has a large and coarse grain size with highly visible crystals It is able to grow large crystals due to being an intrusive igneous rock Granite is formed underground from felsic lava over a lengthy period of time,which results in the formation of large mineral crystals It has a.
