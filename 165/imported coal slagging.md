## Blending of Coals in Power Stations
Coal blending in power stations reduces the cost of generation and increases the availability of coal.Low grade coals can be mixed with better grade coal without deterioration in thermal performance of the boiler thus reducing the cost of generation,but there are many considerations before deciding to blend.Ash Fusion Temperatures22&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Ash fusion temperatures give an indication of the softening and melting behavior of fuel ash.These temperatures are widely cited in fuel specifications for boilers despite a relatively poor record of correlating with slagging or fouling behavior.
