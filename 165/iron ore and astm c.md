## Erosion resistance of arc sprayed coatings to iron ore …
Iron ore pellets are sintered and reduced in large continuous industrial oil fired furnaces.From the furnace,powerful fans extract large volumes of hot gas.Being exposed to gas borne iron ore particles and temperatures ranging between 125 and 328 &#176;C,fan components are rapidly eroded.A Detailed Look at Iron Ore AgglomerationPellets around 10 mesh provide a happy medium between iron ore fines (crushed ground iron ore) and a chunk of iron (mined) for use in a blast furnace.Pelletization offers an effective solution to the items noted above.The ‘recipe’ for successful pelletization,however,is determined through testing.Iron Ore Agglomeration Tests
