## Friction and Friction Coefficients
14&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The friction force is the force exerted by a surface when an object moves across it or makes an effort to move across it.The frictional force can be expressed as.F f = μ N (1).where.F f = frictional force (N,lb).μ = static (μ s) or kinetic (μ k) frictional coefficient.N = normal force between the surfaces (N,lb) There are at least two types of friction forcesTypical control valve datasheet pneumatically actuated,Type of fluid through the valve Process properties of the fluid (viscosity,vapor pressure etc),in order to be able to inform about any special design conditions,like for example possibility for flashing etcNormal,maximum and minimum flowrate values through the control valve need to be specified,in order to be able to calculate the design flow coefficient Kv Cv of the valve and the valve.
