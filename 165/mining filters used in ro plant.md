## Reverse Osmosis Enviro Concepts
6&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Reverse osmosis is a process most commonly used to treat brackish water (water that is more salty than fresh water with &lt;14000ppm of salt) and seawater (water that has more than 14,000ppm of salt).The untreated water is forced through a semi permeable membrane to overcome the osmotic pressure of the high salt concentration in the untreated water.FILTRATION8&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The material used in filters for public water supply is normally a bed of sand,coal,or other granular substance.Filtration processes can generally be classified as being either slow or rapid.Slow sand filters are the original form of filtration.The first one was built in 1804 by John Gibb of Paisley,Scotland to treat water for his
