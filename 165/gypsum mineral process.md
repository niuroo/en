## The Basics of Drying Gypsum
The Role of Drying in Gypsum Mineral Processing.After gypsum ore is extracted from mines or quarries,it is crushed and stockpiled as needed.If the gypsum ore’s moisture content is greater than 0.5 weight percent,then the material requires drying.A gypsum dryer is commonly used to reduce the moisture content of the ore to the necessary level.An experimental study of accelerated mineral carbonation of.17&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;This study provides a novel approach to sequester carbon dioxide (CO2) using industrial waste red gypsum (RG) in an accelerated mineral carbonation process.In this study,RG samples and products were characterized by X ray diffraction (XRD),X ray.

## How Is Gypsum Formed? Hunker
Gypsum is a sedimentary rock and a crystalline mineral.“Gypsum is a soft,white to gray,&quot;chalky&quot; mineral composed of calcium sulfate and water,” says Raymond Anderson of Iowa’s Department of Natural Resources.Gypsum’s chemical symbol is CaSO4•2H2O.Found in many parts of the world,it can occur as crystals or as deposits in beds.Making Gypsum Board Gypsum AssociationTo produce gypsum board,crushed natural gypsum or synthetic gypsum is is heated or calcined to dehydrate the feedstock.Next the calcined gypsum is mixed with water and additives to form a slurry which is fed between continuous layers of recycled paper on a long board machine.
