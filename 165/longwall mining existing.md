## Longwall Mining Overview Introduction …
LONGWALL MINING Overview.In the method of secondary extraction known as longwall mining a relatively long mining face (typically in the range 100 to 300m but may be longer) is created by driving a roadway at right angles between two roadways that form the sides of the longwall block,with one rib of this new roadway forming the longwall face.Agenda Longwall USADaniel Sharpe,longwall mining engineer,Komatsu Mining.The model indicated a potential increase of up to 70% in development rates over the existing mining system forecasting a baseline of 225 feet per shift for the rapid entry development system.Coordination of equipment delivery and assembly was established between mine and KMC.
