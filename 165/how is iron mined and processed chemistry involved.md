## How iron is made
Magnetite and hematite are iron oxides; however,the extraction of iron from an iron oxide involves a series of steps that begins when mined iron ore is crushed into smaller pieces by a crusher and then washed.The second step in the process is calcination or roasting of the ore,which removes certain impurities,carbon dioxide and other.The Ironmaking Process New Zealand Steel6&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The molten iron has a dissolved carbon content of approximately 3.6% as well as some silicon,manganese,vanadium,and titanium.Slag,which floats on top of the iron,has the function of removing impurities from the iron and its chemical composition and temperature to a large extent determine the chemistry and hence quality of the iron.
