## Cupels,Cupels and Cupellation
The lead buttons are allowed to &quot;open&quot;,that is to become molten.When the cupellation is &quot;driving&quot; or the lead is being absorbed into the cupel or driven off as lead oxide,the furnace is opened slightly to provide a draft.The lead is absorbed leaving behind a tiny dor&#233; bead containing the gold and silver.The cupels are allowed to cool.Use button in a sentence button sentence examplesIf the lead is therefore rightly proportioned to the standard of alloy,the resulting button will consist of only gold and silver,and these are separated by the operation of parting,which consists in boiling the alloy (after rolling it to a thin plate) in strong nitric acid,which dissolves the silver and leaves the gold as a coherent sponge.

## Basic Fire assay techniques for gold and silver
14&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;A regular fire assay is not within reach of many prospectors,for the necessary apparatus cannot,as a rule,be carried in the wilderness.Whenever possible,however,a fire assay gives the truest results,especially in the case of gold and silver.The operation includes testing the ore,sampling and pulverizing,weighing the ore and reagents,calcination and roasting,reduction and fusion.Fire Assay Procedure7&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The process of parting gold with nitric acid is old,and probably dates from the discovery of nitric acid itself; it is one of the simplest parting processes,and does not require a costly plant or much manipulative skill.The main objection to it is the cost of the acid.The operation comprises the preparation of a suitable alloy.

## Gold Fire Assay Process
7&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The Gold Fire Assay Process of ores is almost universally conducted in the dry procedure by furnace methods.Exceptions will be noted later.The plan of operation is to concentrate the precious metal in a button of lead either (1) Fire Assay By fusion in a crucible; or,more rarely,(2) Fire Assay By scorification.The button of lead obtained by either method is then subjected to cupellation.How to refine gold without hydrochloric acidActually hydrochloric acid by itself does nothing itself to help refine gold.It is a good cleaning agent to remove residue from the surface of gold particles allowing them to be more easily amalgamated with mercury,but white vinegar works nearly.
