## Why use Flyash in concrete?
Fly ash is one of the pozzolanic admixtures.Pozzolanic admixtures are those materials which in itself do not possess any cementitious qualities but show cementitious properties in their finely divided form when combined with lime,in the presence.Fly Ash Properties and Uses Monolithic Dome InstituteFly ash closely resembles volcanic ashes used in production of the earliest known hydraulic cements about 2,300 years ago.Those cements were made near the small Italian town of Pozzuoli which later gave its name to the term pozzolan.A pozzolan is a siliceous aluminous material that,when mixed with lime and water,forms a cementitious compound.Fly ash is the best known,and one of the.
