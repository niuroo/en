## GOLD RECOVERY FROM PRINTED CIRCUIT BOARDS …
The gold content found in these PCBs is much higher than the average levels found in gold ore,which is currently 10 g of gold per tonne of ore.In leaching tests with commercial (cyanide based) stripping,it was possible to extract 88% of the gold present in PCBs.Silver recoveryLeaching of a high grade gold silver ore with the CELP resulted in higher silver and gold extractions while using a lower cyanide concentration.
