## New Low Temperature Technology of Producing Calcium …
New Low Temperature Technology of Producing Calcium Feed Phosphate with Microelements.The possibility of producing feed calcium phosphates in a way ensuring a low physical water content in the product was investigated in laboratory conditions.For this purpose the process use of a.chemical feed phosphate production technologies.Minerals for Beef Cattle Manitoba.Calcium.Most forages are good sources of calcium,although some,like annual cereals and corn silage,are marginal to low in this mineral.Grain,on the other hand,is a poor source of calcium.Calcium deficiency is not very common in animals on mostly forage diets.Deficiency can result in abnormal bone growth and reduced milk production.
