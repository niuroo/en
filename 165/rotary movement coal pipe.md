## Introduction to Pneumatic Conveying of Solids
Pneumatic conveying is the movement of solids through pipe using gas (usually air) as the motive force.It differs from hydraulic or slurry conveying in that the gas expands continuously along the pipe length.The flow regime in the pipe depends greatly on the ratio of solids to gas and the particle characteristics.Lime Rotary Kiln30&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Lime rotary kiln is the main equipment of lime production line The lime rotary kiln consists of cylindrical shell,supporting device,supporting device of thrust roller,driving unit,moveable kiln head,sealing device on the tail of kiln,coal dust pipe device,etc,the kiln body has a certain tilt angle with level
