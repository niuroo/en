## What is bulk density of cement,aggregate,sand? Quora
The bulk density is the mass of the material related to a specific volume and for cement is normally expressed as “kilograms per cubic metre”.The bulk density reflects the volume taken up by the cement plus any air trapped between the particles.A Detailed Guide on Grading of Aggregates.19&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The aggregate sample is sieved through a set of sieves and weights retained on each sieve in percentage terms are summed up.On dividing this sum by 100,The Fineness Modulus of that aggregate is determined.This helps in deciding about the quantity of aggregates of known fineness moduli to be mixed for obtaining a concrete of desired density.
