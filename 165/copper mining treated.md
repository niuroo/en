Copper processing is a complicated process that begins with mining of the ore (less than 1% copper) and ends with sheets of 99.99% pure copper called cathodes,which will ultimately be made into products for everyday use.The most common types of ore,copper oxide and copper sulfide,undergo two different processes,hydrometallurgy and pyrometallurgy,respectively,due to the different.Copper mining.From ore to copper.13&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The ore is treated with dilute sulphuric acid.This trickles slowly through the ore dissolving copper to form copper sulphate.The copper is recovered by electrolytic refining.Advantages of this process are: much less energy is use than in traditional mining no waste gases are given off
