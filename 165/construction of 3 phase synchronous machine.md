## Three Phase Synchronous Machines
1&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Three Phase Synchronous Machines The synchronous machine can be used to operate as: 1.Synchronous motors 2.Synchronous generators (Alternator) Synchronous generator is also referred to as alternator since it generates alternating voltage.Synchronous machine is designed to be operating at synchronous speed,nS.Two main parts:EE 340 Spring 201129&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;synchronous reactance of the machine: X X X SA V E jX I RI I A S A A Therefore,the phase voltage is The equivalent circuit of a phase synchronous generator is shown.The adjustable resistor R adj controls the field current and,therefore,the rotor magnetic field.
