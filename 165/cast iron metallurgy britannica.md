## History of ferrous metallurgy
The history of ferrous metallurgy began far back in prehistory,most likely with the use of iron from meteorites.The smelting of iron in bloomeries began in the 12th century BC in India,Anatolia or the Caucasus.Iron use,in smelting and forging for tools,appeared in Sub Saharan Africa by 1200 BC.[1] The use of wrought iron was known in the 1st millennium BC.Cementite Definition of Cementite at Dictionary.comCementite definition,an iron carbide,Fe3C,a constituent of steel and cast iron,sometimes with part of its iron replaced by another metal,as manganese.See more.

## iron st processing
Cast iron Wikipedia.Cast iron's properties are changed by adding various alloying elements,or alloyants.Next to carbon,silicon is the most important alloyant because it forces carbon out of solution.A low percentage of silicon allows carbon to remain in solution forming iron carbide and the production of white cast iron.Crucible Cast Steel29&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;CRUCIBLE CAST STEEL.The crucible process,the oldest of the four leading methods for the manufacture of steel,and one which holds the premier position for quality,came into use in 1870 as the result of experiments by Benjamin Huntsman,who attempted to modify the irregularity of the imported blister steel or converted bar,and ultimately succeeded by melting the steel in crucibles.
