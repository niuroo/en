## Coal explained
Types of coal.Coal is classified into four main types,or ranks: anthracite,bituminous,subbituminous,and lignite.The ranking depends on the types and amounts of carbon the coal contains and on the amount of heat energy the coal can produce.The rank of a coal deposit is determined by the amount of pressure and heat that acted on the plants.COAL CHARACTERISTICS8&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;COAL TYPES Geologists also classify coal types according to the organic debris,called macerals,from which the coal is formed.Macerals (microscopic organic constituents found in coal) are identified (microscopically) by reflected light the reflective or translucent properties of the coal indicating the individual component macerals
