## On the Crush Worthiness of a Laterally Confined Bar Under,
The specific crush energy is little sensitive to the thickness of the bar but strongly varies with t ∕ h ⁠,the “volume fraction” of the structure,attaining a maximum when t ∕ h ≈ 05 ⁠Energy Absorption and Crush Behavior of the Layered.Abstract.To investigate the energy absorption characteristics and crush behavior of layered aluminum honeycomb,the experiments of layered aluminum honeycomb structure under quasi static load had been carried out,mainly includes single,double,triple,four layer combinations.
