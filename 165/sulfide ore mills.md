## Sulfide Ores
Sulfide Ores.Sulphide ores were mostly created by (i) the intrusion of molten magma from the mantle into the crust of the earth and (ii) the formation of localized metal rich sulphide ore bodies by sequential solidification and or hydrothermal leaching and precipitation.From: Extractive Metallurgy of Nickel,Cobalt and Platinum Group Metals,2011Ultra fine Vortex mill for sulfide gold ore&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Vortex Air mill can mill dry and wet material.On this video pulv

## Science Desk: How Sulfide Ore Copper Mines Pollute Save.
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Have you ever wondered just how sulfide ore copper mines pollute their surrounding environments? It’s a good question,because in order to understand the environmental impacts to the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness and Voyageurs National Park,we must first understand all of the ways sulfide ore copper mining can cause harm to the surrounding lakes,streams,wetlands and …Copper Mining and Processing: Processing of Copper Ores.Copper processing is a complicated process that begins with mining of the ore (less than 1% copper) and ends with sheets of 99.99% pure copper called cathodes,which will ultimately be made into products for everyday use.The most common types of ore,copper oxide and copper sulfide,undergo two different processes,hydrometallurgy and pyrometallurgy,respectively,due to the different.

## Sulfide
Sphalerite.Sphalerite is a mineral,the chief ore of zinc.It consists of zinc sulfide in crystalline form but always contains variable iron; when iron content is high it is an opaque black variety,marmatite.It is found in association with galena and other sulfides along with calcite and fluorite.Miners have been known to refer to sphalerite as zinc blende,black jack and ruby jack; the.How to Extract Precious Metals From Sulfides SciencingPrecious metals can be found in ore deposits along with sulfur,and are known as sulfides.Cadmium,cobalt,copper,lead,molybdenum,nickel,silver,zinc,and gold and platinum group metals can be found in sulfide forms.These concentrated ore deposits
