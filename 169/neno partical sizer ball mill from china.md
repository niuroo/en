## Nanoparticle
A nanoparticle or ultrafine particle is usually defined as a particle of matter that is between 1 and 100 nanometres (nm) in diameter.The term is sometimes used for larger particles,up to 500 nm,[citation needed] or fibers and tubes that are less than 100 nm in only two directions.At the lowest range,metal particles smaller than 1 nm are usually called atom clusters instead.What is a nanoparticle?Conclusions.The basic definition of a nanoparticle (between 1 100 nm) is common to the documents referenced here.The fact that all of the documents contain one or more nuances to the definition is an indication that the phrase "it depends on the sample" is common in the world of particle characterization.

## ball mill particle size reduction
Ball mill is generally used to grind material 1 4 inch and finer,down to the particle size of 20 to 75 microns.To achieve a reasonable efficiency with ball mills,they must be operated in a closed system,with oversize material continuously being recirculated back into the mill to be reduced.Planetary Ball Mill PM 100Planetary Ball Mills are used wherever the highest degree of fineness is required.In addition to well proven mixing and size reduction processes,these mills also meet all technical requirements for colloidal grinding and provide the energy input necessary for mechanical alloying.The extremely high centrifugal forces of a planetary ball mill result in very high pulverization energy and.
