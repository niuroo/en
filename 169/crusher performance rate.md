## Jaw Crusher
The common crusher types,sizes and their performance are summarised in Table 4.1.Currently,the dimensions of the largest Blake type jaw crusher in use are 1600 mm &#215; 2514 mm with motor ratings of 250 300 kW.Crushers of this size are manufactured by Locomo,Nordberg (Metso) and others.What affects cone crusher performance? — Sandvik Mining.Any fluctuation in pressure means that the optimal force will not be delivered consistently so,of course,crusher performance declines.These are the two main causes of sub optimal crushing performance,but losses in the reduction ratio can also be caused by selecting the wrong mantle or by having a poor chamber profile or design.
