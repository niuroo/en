## Beneficiation Bauxite mineral menggunakan pemisah tali.
For mineral separations,processing bauxite for example.the pre processing of bauxite ores by dry triboelectrostatic separation may result in improved economics of aluminium refining by supplying higher grades of bauxite to the refining process.(larger digestion equipment) and operating costs.Froth flotation WikipediaFroth flotation is a process for selectively separating hydrophobic materials from hydrophilic.This is used in mineral processing,paper recycling and waste water treatment industries.Historically this was first used in the mining industry,where it was one of the great enabling technologies of the 20th century.

## Extraction Process of Aluminium from Bauxite Ore
Alumina Extraction Problem.In the standard Bayer Process for refining bauxite to produce alumina,the dissolution of the alumina in the ore to form sodium aluminate is accomplished in autoclaves under high pressures varying from 70 to 200 pounds per square inch.Investigation of lime usage impacts on bauxite.Before the digestion,addition of 2.11% lime to the bauxite samples decreases the alumina recovery and increases the Na 2 O SiO 2 ratio of red mud with increase in temperature.The highest alumina recovery and the lowest Na 2 O SiO 2 ratio were achieved at 240 °C.It can be explained that lime partly reacts with silica in the bauxite and prevents sodium silicate formation [16,17].

## The Chemistry and Processing of Jamaican Bauxite
In October,1943,Alcan was incorporated under the name Jamaica Bauxites Limited as a Jamaican company to investigate the commercial potential of Jamaican bauxite.In the same year,2500 tonnes of ore was shipped to the USA for process investigation and it was realised that the bauxite was suitable for processing using Bayer technology.Decreasing Yield and Alumina Content of Red Mud by.Bauxite produces 60 120 million tons of toxic red mud annually during its processing to alumina.Thus,in this work,the modeling of the bauxite processing process to reduce quantity of red mud produced and with low alumina content was envisaged.Bauxite from Minim Martap was processed by adapting the Bayer process under laboratory conditions.

## Extraction Process of Aluminium from Bauxite Ore
Bauxite is aluminium rich ore that is used for aluminium production (the metallurgical bauxites) and for production of refractory materials,chemicals or cements (the non metallurgical bauxites).Metallurgical bauxites are sub divided into two basic types based on the processing methods that must be applied to them at the alumina refinery stage.
