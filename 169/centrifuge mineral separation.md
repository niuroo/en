## Separation solutions for mineral slurries
For the separation of slimes and dewatering of slurries containing fine particles,ITE GmbH relies on centrifuge systems (Fig.4).Separation is also based on the principle of sedimentation.Thanks to the high centrifugal acceleration,the forces acting on the feed are much higher than in gravimetric sedimentation.Hydrocyclonenbsp 0183 32 A hydrocyclone often referred to by the shortened form cyclone is a device to classify separate or sort particles in a liquid suspension based on the ratio of their centripetal force to fluid resistance This ratio is high for dense where separation by density is required and coarse where separation by size is required particles and
