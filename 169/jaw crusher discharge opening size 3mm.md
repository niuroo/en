## Jaw Crusher Working Principle
Primary crushing with jaw crushers.In terms of the size of the feed opening,the client gets a better return on investment when the primary crusher is a jaw crusher.That means less drilling and blasting because the crusher accepts larger boulders.Cause Analysis and Problems Solving of Jaw Crusher HXJQ3 The discharge opening is adjusted to the nominal discharge opening specified in the manual and the crusher used for fine crushing is added.4 Check the tooth gap size of the tooth plate.If it does not meet the standard,the jaw plate must be replaced,and the relative position of the fixed jaw plate and the movable jaw plate should be.
