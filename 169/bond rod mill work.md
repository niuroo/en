## SAG Mill Testing
The design of rod and ball mills is still carried out with the Bond ball mill and rod mill grindability tests.As discussed earlier in this paper,it is important in this case to match the reduction size of the test to that desired from the industrial mill.As such,primary ball mills should be designed with the rod mTubular Rod MillsDuring operation of rod mills,rods have to be replaced occasionally as they are subjected to wear and liable to break.The replacement rate should be equal to the rate at which rod size deterioration occurs so that equilibrium is maintained.Bond determined the equilibrium rod sizes in the same manner as for a ball charge.
