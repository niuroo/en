## Ball Mill: Operating principles,components,Uses.
A ball mill also known as pebble mill or tumbling mill is a milling machine that consists of a hallow cylinder containing balls; mounted on a metallic frame such that it can be rotated along its longitudinal axis.The balls which could be of different diameter occupy 30 50% of the mill volume and its size depends on the feed and mill size.Ball MillsVery large tonnages can be ground with these ball mills because they are very effective material handling devices.Ball mills are rated by power rather than capacity.Today,the largest ball mill in operation is 8.53 m diameter and 13.41 m long with a corresponding motor power of 22 MW (Toromocho,private communications).

## Difference Between Sag Mill vs Ball Mill
The ball charge of a SAG mill is about 29% to 30%.By friction and influence of tumbling balls inside rotating cylinder grinds the raw material to the required fineness.The internal machinery of ball mill grinds the raw material into the powder like material,And if extreme fineness and refinery are required then rotation go on continue.Planetary Ball Mill PM 100Planetary Ball Mills are used wherever the highest degree of fineness is required.In addition to well proven mixing and size reduction processes,these mills also meet all technical requirements for colloidal grinding and provide the energy input necessary for mechanical alloying.The extremely high centrifugal forces of a planetary ball mill result in very high pulverization energy and.
