## Horizontal Coarse Grinding Mill Rod Mill Product.
Unlike the Ball Mill,however,the Rod Mill uses rods instead of balls as the grinding medium.As a result,its uses are different from those with the Ball Mill.In other words,the Rod Mill gives impact on and grinds coarse particles present between each rod,while no fine particles receive impact and are ground.Rod mill&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;The rods crush the rock and as the charge passes through the mill it is reduced in size to approximately 2mm to 0.1mm.6.# Feed enters &amp; Product out in mill 7.The mill can be fed from one end with the product removed from the other end or,alternatively,the mill can be fed from both ends with the discharge at the centre.
