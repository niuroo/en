## Jaw Crusher
Typical cross section of Stag jaw crusher.Stag crushers are made with jaw widths varying from about 150 mm to 1.0 m and the running speed is about 4 Hz (240 rpm) with the smaller machines running at the higher speeds.The speed of operation should not be so high that a large quantity of fines is produced as a resIntroduction to Rock Crushers&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Jaw crushers offer reduction ratios of up to about 6:1,while cone crushers can reduce material size up to a maximum of 8:1 ratio.The finer the crushing,the smaller the reduction ratio.As a basic rule,jaw crushers are the primary crusher taking the mined aggregate and reducing i

&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Jaw crusher units with extra long,articulated crusher jaws prevent coarse material from blocking while moving all mounting elements of the crusher jaw from the wear area.A more even material flow may be affected if the transfer from the prescreen or the feeder trough is designed so material simply tilts into the crushing jaw.CrusherThe Blake crusher was patented by Eli Whitney Blake in 1858.The Blake type jaw crusher has a fixed feed area and a variable discharge area.Blake crushers are of two types single toggle and double toggle jaw crushers.In the single toggle jaw crushers,the swing jaw is suspended on the eccentric shaft which leads to a much more compact design.

on the mechanism used crushers are of three types namely Cone crusher,Jaw crusher and Impact crusher.The first stage of size reduction of hard and large lumps of run of mine (ROM) ore is to crush and reduce their size.Large scale crushing operations are generally performedCrushing 101 MasabaThe width of the jaw determines capacity.Jaw crusher output gradation is controlled by the closed side setting.This is the adjustable opening at the bottom of the jaw.With a 24” top size limit and an 8:1 reduction ration,the closed side setting should be no smaller than 3”.A well designed jaw should be 80 to 85 percent efficient.
