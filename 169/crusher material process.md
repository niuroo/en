## What a Can Crusher Is and How it works
nbsp 0183 32 This process is for a single can crusher but there are also semi automatic can crushers that can hold multiple cans at the same time These can crushers have a collection tray on top of the crusher where you can place multiple cans from 4 up to 10 depending on type of the semi automatic crusherCrusherA crusher is a machine designed to reduce large rocks into smaller rocks,gravel,or rock dust.Crushers may be used to reduce the size,or change the form,of waste materials so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled,or to reduce the size of a solid mix of raw materials (as in rock ore),so that pieces of different composition can be differentiated.
