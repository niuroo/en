## Metamorphic rock
Metamorphic rocks arise from the transformation of existing rock types,in a process called metamorphism,which means &quot;change in form&quot;.The original rock is subjected to heat (temperatures greater than 150 to 200 &#176;C) and pressure (100 megapascals (1,000 bar) or more),causing profound physical or chemical change.The protolith may be a sedimentary,igneous,Geologic units in Wisconsin (state in United States)Jordan Sandstone,St Lawrence and Lone Rock formations (Upper Cambrian,upper Steptoean Sunwaptan lower Skullrockian [formerly middle Franconian Trempealeauan)) at surface,covers &lt; 0.1 % of this area.Surface exposures limited to Allamakee and northeast Clayton counties; subcrops beneath Mississippi River alluvium in southern Allamakee and Clayton counties.
