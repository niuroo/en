## Cryogenic hardening
Cryogenic hardening is a cryogenic treatment process where the material is cooled to approximately −185 &#176;C (−301 &#176;F),usually using liquid nitrogen.It can have a profound effect on the mechanical properties of certain steels,provided their composition and prior heat treatment are such that they retain soBrymill Cryogenic Systems Liquid Nitrogen Cryosurgery.Brymill sets the industry standard for hand held liquid nitrogen cryosurgical and cryospray products,including our Cry Ac&#174; and Cry Ac&#174; 3 devices.From our Ellington,CT,headquarters,we manufacture equipment used by the world’s physicians and veterinarians.
