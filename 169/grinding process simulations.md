## Simulation analysis of grinding wheel motion…
In grinding process of SiC ceramics aspheric surface,the motion trajectory of grinding wheel has great influence on the surface forming.The paper providesGRINDING PROCESS SIMULATION BASED ON ROSIN RAMMLER.In many grinding cases,mainly during the last stages of the process,the cumulative particle size distribution is found to follow the Rosin Rammler equation (RR),the parameters of which can be used as essential criteria to the operation progress.
