The Homebrew Review Barley Crusher Grain Mill.I think the Barley Crusher Grain Mill is still the best bang for the buck at $149.99,well at Northern Brewer anyways,about 10 bucks more than when I bought mine 2 years ago come July.It comes with everything pictured,unlike the expensive mills where everything comes separately.Here it is sittinGrain MillO,I'm embarassed :oops:.I saw that thread,and even though I was looking for something on the barley crusher,I didn't clue in to the fact that &quot;barley crusher&quot; was the brand not just another term for grain mill.I don't know where my head's at today lol.
