## Environmental impact of phosphate mining and beneficiation,
Phosphorus is normally produced by mining and beneficiation of Phosphate or 3 Mines produce large amounts of waste including toxic metals and radioactive elements 4 The mining and beneficiation process results in the majority of these hazardous elements being lost either to waste disposal or to the environment,mainly soil,water.
