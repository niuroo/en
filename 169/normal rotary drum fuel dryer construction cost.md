## 3 CALCULATION OF MACHINE RATES
31 Introduction The unit cost of logging or road construction is essentially derived by dividing cost by production In its simplest case,if you rented a tractor with operator for $60 per hour including all fuel and other costs and you excavated 100 cubic meters per hour,your unit cost for excavation would be $060 per cubic meterDiy Zombie Decorationsnbsp 0183 32 However after learning that it would cost about 500 i realized that this wasnt an option for me Buffet sneeze guards glass modification duration A sneeze guard is a barrier placed between people and food to protect the food from bacteria and other germs especially those spread by sneezing which can propel bacteria outwards at a speed up to 40 miles per hour
