## Airflow Dryer Machine,High Efficiency Sawdust Dryer
Introduction of Airflow Dryer The airflow dryer is mainly used to control the moisture content of raw material before pelletizing.A reasonable moisture range of material can make sure the good quality of pellets.Featured with wide application,this equipment can be suitable for rice hulls,sawdust,smashed bubble flowers,and other granular materials.How long does the HGM calcium carbonate mill wear parts last?Compared with airflow mill and agitating mill,the output is up to 45%.Above,the wearing parts are low in loss,and all the wearing parts are made of high quality wear resistant materials at home and abroad,which is longer than the wearing parts of ordinary grinding equipment,and can generally be as long as more than one year.

## 5.FANS AND BLOWERS
In any fan system,the resistance to air flow (pressure) increases when the flow of air is increased.As mentioned before,it varies as the square of the flow.The pressure required by a system over a range of flows can be determined and a &quot;system performance curve&quot; …What is Raymond Mill Working Principle?&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Working principle After Raymond mill crushes the bulk raw material to the required feed size,the material is conveyed to the storage bin by the bucket elevator,and then sent to the grinding chamber of the main engine by the electromagnetic feede.
