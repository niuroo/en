Apr 17,2017&#0183;&#32;Electrowinning as an extraction process is especially important for copper and silver And with advanced “vortex” emew electrowinning technology the process is even more efficient ensuring the purity of metal can be plated to as high "Five Nines" (99999%) along with the ability to deplete metals down to low concentrations (< 10 ppm)Electroplating: Copper Plated Key Home Science ToolsOne fun idea is to use a flat piece of brass as your cathode and draw a design on it with an oil based marker The copper will not bond where the marker is After you're done plating it,you can use acetone (or nail polish remover) to wipe off the marker,leaving a design of the brass showing through the copper
