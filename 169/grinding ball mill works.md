## The operating principle of the ball mill
The operating principle of the ball mill consists of following steps.In a continuously operating ball mill,feed material fed through the central hole one of the caps into the drum and moves therealong,being exposed by grinding media.The material grinding occurs during impact falling grindinGrinding Balls &amp; RodsThese balls may be had in two types: a soft ball Brinnell 450+ for large diameter ball mills,and a hard ball Brinnell 600+ for small ball mills.The addition of molybdenum,chromium and manganese provides an excellent microstructure for these grinding balls.Balls are available in 4″,3&#189;”,3″,2&#189;”,and 2″ sizes.

## Ball mill
The ball mill is a key piece of equipment for grinding crushed materials,and it is widely used in production lines for powders such as cement,silicates,refractory material,fertilizer,glass ceramics,etc.as well as for ore dressing of both ferrous and non ferrous metals.The ball mill can grind various ores and other materials either wet or dry.Ball Mill Henan Deya Machinery Co.Ltd.Ball Mill Introduction.Ball mill works on the principle of impact: size reduction is done by impact as the balls drop from near the top of the shell.A ball mill consists of a hollow cylindrical shell rotating about its axis.The axis of the shell may be either horizontal or at a small angle to the horizontal.it is partially filled with balls.

## The hardness of grinding media ball
From the way the ball mill works.In the operation environment,the ball mill is divided into two types: wet ball mill and dry ball mill.Dry Ball millwork has a strong corrosion,so as the same wear resistant grinding media ball,the wear resistant grinding media ball in the wet grinding efficiency is faster.HOW BALL MILL WORKS?&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;The ball mill is a hollow drum closed with loading and unloading end caps,filled with grinding media and rotated around its axis.The drum of the ball mill (Pic.1) is a hollow cylinder of steel,lined inside with armor lining plates which protect it from impact and friction effects of the
