&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Charles Babbage (1791 1871),computer pioneer,designed two classes of engine,Difference Engines,and Analytical Engines.Difference engines are so called because of the mathematicSketch of The Analytical EngineGenerally,since every analytical expression is susceptible of being expressed in a series ordered according to certain functions of the variable,we perceive that the machine will include all analytical calculations which can be definitively reduced to the formation of coefficients according to certai

## The Analytical Engine
The only part of the Analytical engine which has yet been put together is a small portion of “the mill,” sufficient to show the methods of addition and subtraction,and of what Mr.Babbage called his “anticipating carriage.” It is understood that General Babbage will (independently of this report) publish a full account of this method.
