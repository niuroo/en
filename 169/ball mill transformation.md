## Ball mill
The ball mill is a key piece of equipment for grinding crushed materials,and it is widely used in production lines for powders such as cement,silicates,refractory material,fertilizer,glass ceramics,etc.as well as for ore dressing of both ferrous and non ferrous metals.The ball mill can grind various ores and other materials either wet.Ray transfer matrix analysisnbsp 0183 32 Ray transfer matrix analysis also known as ABCD matrix analysis is a mathematical form for performing ray tracing calculations in sufficiently simple problems which
