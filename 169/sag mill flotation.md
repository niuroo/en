## SAG Mill Process Control
If the SAG mill is not intended to be the rate limiting step in a process plant,then it is best to adjust the SAG load (and power) to hold a constant tonnage to satisfy another constraint elsewhere.Underground mines are an example: the hoisting capacity of the mine shaft is the rate limiting step in the proce
