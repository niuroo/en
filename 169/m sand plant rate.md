## Sand Media Specifications
media for intermittent sand filters is a coarse sand with an effective size between 03 mm and 05 mm The media sand grains should be relatively uniform in size having a low Uc value (less than 40) to promote movement of water and prevent clogging KEYWORDS: sand media specifications,filter media,media grain sizeCIVL 1101 Introduction to Filtration 1 15 MemphisFiltration Type Application Rate m hr gal ft2 day Slow Sand 004 to 04 340 to 3400 Rapid Sand 04 to 31 3400 to 26,000 2 In the United States,filter application rates are often expressed as volumetric flowrate per area,or gal min ft2,which is actually a velocity with atypical units Hydraulic Loading Rate

## CHAPTER 2 SOIL AND WATER
The sand is said to have a higher infiltration rate Fig 32a The same amount of water is supplied to each glass Fig 32b After one hour the water has infiltrated in the sand,while some water is still ponding on the clay The infiltration rate of a soil is the velocity at which water can seep into it3 SALINE SOILS AND THEIR MANAGEMENTConductivity to mg l: mg l = 064 √ó EC x 10 3,or (EC in dS m) mg l = 640 √ó EC for waters and soil extracts having conductivity up to 5 dS m nmol l (chemical analysis) to mg l: Multiply mmol l for each ion by its molar weight and obtain the sum There is no critical point of salinity where plants fail to grow
