## Reviewing a Certified Mill Test Report Meyer Tool &amp; MFG
Whether manufacturing a large cryogenic module or a small flange adapter,using the correct material as determined in engineering for each component is critical.The Certified Mill Test Report is a tool used to ensure that received raw material matches the engineering and purchase order requirements.Conversion of Mill Scale Waste into Valuable Products via.Mill scale is one of waste materials which is produced as a result of hot rolling of steel in all steel companies.On the other hand,mill scale is considered a rich iron source with minimum impurities.This work aims at conversion of mill scale by adjusting smelting processes to produce different valuable products.The smelting processes were carried out using carbothermic reduction in a.
