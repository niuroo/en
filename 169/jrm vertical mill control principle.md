&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Let me first introduce you about what is CNC machine,so CNC stands for Computer Numerical Control.When computers are used to control a Numerical Control (NC) machine tool than the machine is called CNC machine.In other words the use of computers to control machine tools like lathe,mills,Outotec HIGmill high intensity grinding millThe control principle is to measure scalping cyclone feed quantity and adjust the mill shaft speed to reach target energy per total feed flow.Alternatively,particle size distribution is measured by the Outotec&#174; PSI&#174; on line particle analyzer and the shaft speed adjusted to maintain constant product size.A compact,simple installation and.
