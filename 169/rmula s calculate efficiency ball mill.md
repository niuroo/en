## Ball mill
A ball mill,a type of grinder,is a cylindrical device used in grinding (or mixing) materials like ores,chemicals,ceramic raw materials and paints.Ball mills rotate around a horizontal axis,partially filled with the material to be ground plus the grinding medium.Different materials are used as media,including ceramic balls,flint pebbles andImproving Grinding Efficiency with the IsaMill™Improving Grinding Efficiency with the IsaMill™ M.Larson1,R.Morrison1,F.Shi1 and M.F.Young2 1University of Queensland,JKMRC,QLD 2Xstrata Technology,QLD Introduction,Backgr
