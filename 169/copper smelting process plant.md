## AP 42,CH 129: Secondary Copper Smelting
The principal pollutant emitted from secondary copper smelting activities is particulate matter As is characteristic of secondary metallurgical industries,pyrometallurgical processes used to separate or refine the desired metal,such as the burning of insulation from copper wire,result in emissions of metal oxides and unburned insulationAncient Mining Tools and Techniquesnbsp 0183 32 Slow going and dangerous it may have been but ancient mining techniques were clever The earliest mines sought cosmetic pigments for funerals Picks and hammer stones are examples of stone age tools Later ancient man discovered metals which provided

## Copper extraction Wikipedia
The matte,which is produced in the smelter,contains 30 70% copper (depending on the process used and the operating philosophy of the smelter),primarily as copper sulfide,as well as iron sulfide The sulfur is removed at high temperature as sulfur dioxide by blowing air through molten matte: 2 CuS + 3 O 2 → 2 CuO + 2 SO 2 CuS + O 2.ASARCO » RefiningSince anodes are already 99% pure copper when they come from the smelter,why go through all this effort for that extra one percent? It all has to do with the physical properties of copper that make it so useful The Refining Process The process of passing an electric current through a liquid from one electrode to another is called electrolysis

## The Disadvantages of Smelter Sciencing
The process of smelting is when industrial factories extract or smelter purer and more refined metals from or Metals like copper or lead are often extracted using this process from earth samples and deposits Although smelting helps with metal productions,there are many disadvantages to smelting that impact the.Copper in the USA: Copper ProducersCopper in the USA: Bright Future Glorious Past Copper Producers At the beginning of copper's flow through the economy are the mining companies,which process vast quantities of low grade ore,mostly from open pit mines in order to produce copper Approximately two tons of overburden must be removed along with each ton of copper ore

## Flash Smelting Process Outotec
The Outotec Flash Smelting Process is one of the world’s most commonly used processes for the production of primary copper and nickel The process is based on our flash smelting principle,which utilizes the internal energy of the feed material for smelting,minimizing the need for external fuel and making the process very energy efficientCopper Purification Process Electrolytic Copper Refining,Purification of Impure Copper can be Achieved by Electrolytic Refining What is impure copper: The smelting process takes copper ore and processes it into metal This metal (sometimes called “blister copper” contains other metals (impurities) which often include valuable metals as gold,silver,arsenic,platinum and others
