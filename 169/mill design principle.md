## Three Basic Principles of Utilitarianism
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Utilitarianism is one of the most important and influential moral theories of modern times.In many respects,it is the outlook of Scottish philosopher David Hume (1711 1776) and his writings from the mid 18th century.But it received both its name and its clearest statement in the writings of English philosophers Jeremy Bentham (1748 1832) and John Stuart Mill (1806 1873).Ball Mill Design Power CalculationThe basic parameters used in ball mill design (power calculations),rod mill or any tumbling mill sizing are; material to be ground,characteristics,Bond Work Index,bulk density,specific density,desired mill tonnage capacity DTPH,operating % solids or pulp density,feed size as F80 and maximum ‘chunk size’,product size as P80 and maximum and finally the type of circuit open closed.
