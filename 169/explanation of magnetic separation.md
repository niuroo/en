## surface finish and magnetic attraction
nbsp 0183 32 The reason that smooth mating surfaces are held more tightly by magnetic force than rough non mating ones is twofold 1 The force depends on the rate of change of magnetic field strength with separation distance 2 Steels typically have about 1000 times moreCoprecipitationnbsp 0183 32 On the other hand in the analysis of trace elements as is often the case in radiochemistry coprecipitation is often the only way of separating an element Since the trace element is too dilute sometimes less than a part per trillion to precipitate by conventional means it is typically coprecipitated with a carrier a substance that has a
