## Effects of ball milling on the structural,thermal,and.
Longer ball milling time,regardless the applied speed,demonstrated greater effect on protein conformational changes due to simultaneous mechanical impact.Similar result of increasing α helix and decreasing β sheet structure after ball milling soy protein isolate has been reported (Liu et al.2017).Separation in liquid and the formation of supersaturated.The original powder was produced via the mechanical milling of iron and copper powders in a planetary type ball mill.It has been found that the structure of the compacted specimens produced using rapid laser melting

## Flow separation
Flow separation occurs when the boundary layer travels far enough against an adverse pressure gradient that the speed of the boundary layer relative to the object falls almost to zero.The fluid flow becomes detached from the surface of the object,and instead takes the forms of eddies and vortices.MillstoneMillstones for some water powered mills (such as Peirce Mill) spin at about 125 rpm.Especially in the case of wind powered mills the turning speed can be irregular.Higher speed means more grain is fed to the stones by the feed shoe,and grain exits the stones more quickly because of their faster turning speed.

## Mill (grinding)
A mill is a device that breaks solid materials into smaller pieces by grinding,crushing,or cutting.Such comminution is an important unit operation in many processes.There are many different types of mills and many types of materials processed in them.Historically mills were powered by hand (e.g.via a hand crank),working animal (e.g.horse mill),wind or water ().PDF Variables and Applications on Dry Magnetic Separatornbsp 0183 32 Magnetic separation is an indispensable part of magnetic separation and the dry magnetic separator can be selected under the condition of water shortage in China to ensure that our country can
