## Jaw Crushers
A critical point in the operation of large jaw crushers is the arrangement of swing jaw and its supporting shaft.While in most crushers the jaw is pressed on the shaft and the latter swings in frame,in the jaw crusher the opposite principle is used—shaft is clamped in frame and jaw swings on shaft! Another point has been lubrication.Jaw Models &amp; Literature Lippmann MilwaukeeLippmann Milwaukee jaw crushers are fabricated with an extra heavily ribbed steel plate construction to provide maximum strength and durability while in operation.Frames are stress relieved before machining and after welding to ensure the highest quality product.
