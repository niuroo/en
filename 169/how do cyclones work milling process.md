## Fluid Quip Germ Separation Systems
If floor space is limited,or the area is irregular,we can custom design the system to fit Full port ball valves allow individual cyclones to be taken off line on the run to steel that is work hardened by the spinning process for abrasion resistance.other 6”,8” and 9” systems commonly used in the corn wet milling industry.Cyclone separatorCyclone separators work much like a centrifuge,but with a continuous feed of dirty air.In a cyclone separator,dirty flue gas is fed into a chamber.The inside of the chamber creates a spiral vortex,similar to a tornado.This spiral formation and the separation is shown in Figure 2.The lighter components of this gas have less inertia,so it.
