## Durability of concrete incorporated with siliceous iron
nbsp 0183 32 As a result more iron tailings are used as fine aggregates in concrete or as siliceous materials for concrete products The chemical reactivity of inorganic materials is mainly decided by their structural stability in general material with more defects in its microstructure more distortion in its lattices or existing in an amorphous state tends to have a high reaction activity2 Types of Concrete Crushers HXJQnbsp 0183 32 The concrete prepared from recycled cement and recycled aggregate can enter the next cycle which realizes zero waste discharge throughout the whole cycle Concrete cement and other wastes in construction waste can be used as building aggregates and recycled brick raw materials after being reasonably crushed screened and crushed
