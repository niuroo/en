## What is bulk density of cement,aggregate,sand?
* The bulk density is the mass of the material related to a specific volume and for cement is normally expressed as “kilograms per cubic metre”.* The bulk density reflects the volume taken up by the cement plus any air trapped between the p.Concrete Mix Design Different Grades of Concrete2020 2 24&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Concrete Mix Design: Concrete is a composite mixture which consists of Cement,Sand and Aggregate.Concrete mix design is the procedure for finding the right quantities of these materials to achieve the desired strength.Accurate concrete mix design makes concrete construction economical.
