## Metamorphic Rocks
Metamorphic rocks.Metamorphism is the alteration of pre existing rocks in the solid state due to changes in temperature and pressure.Under increasing temperature and or pressure existing minerals become unstable and break down to form new minerals.In the case of regional metamorphism the rocks are subjected to tectonic forces which provide the necessary mechanisms for metamorphism.Sedimentary rock 4R millVolcanic clastic rock 4r raymond mill.Volcanic clastic rock 4r raymond mill;.Yemen Late JurassicEarly Cretaceous Draft Cretaceous organicrich sedimentary rocks in this subbasin In addition the results of source rock characterisation are incorporated into basin models in order to know and determine the timing of hydrocarbon generation and e
