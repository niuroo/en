## Stamp mill Wikipedia
A stamp mill consists of a set of heavy steel (iron shod wood in some cases) stamps,loosely held vertically in a frame,in which the stamps can slide up and down.They are lifted by cams on a horizontal rotating shaft.As the cam moves from under the stamp,the stamp falls onto the ore below,crushing the rock,and the lifting process is repeated at the next pass of the cam.The working principle of ball mill Meetyou Carbide · The ball mill consists of a metal cylinder and a ball.The working principle is that when the cylinder is rotated,the grinding body (ball) and the object to be polished (material) installed in the cylinder are rotated by the cylinder under the action of friction and centrifugal force.
