## The Special Design of Compound Pendulum Jaw Crusher
The main advantages of compound pendulum jaw crusher are: light weight,simple,reasonable configuration,compact structure,relatively good filling rate of the crushing cavity and even crushing of material.The material will be discharged from the bottom of the movable jaw if it is broken to reasonable particle size.practical physics: experiment 10: Compound PendulumMETHOD: An experimental pendulum is suspended successively about several axes at different points along its length and the period about each axis is observed.A graph is plotted of the period versus the distance of the axis of suspension from one end of the pendulum.The nature of the graph shows the physical properties of the compound pendulum.
