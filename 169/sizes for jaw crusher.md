## Primary Crusher Selection &amp; Design
A gyratory crusher consumes less power when idling and will reduce the size of 2X the rock for the same energy utilized by the jaw crusher.There is less waste or scrap metal coming off a jaw crusher liner (it is reversible) which affords the jaw crusher with a less maintenance.Rock Crushing Rule of ThumbNearly all crushers produce a product that is 40% finer than one half the crusher setting.Source: Babu and Cook; The product of a jaw crusher will have a size distribution such that the 80% fraction size (d80) is slightly less than the open side setting of the crusher.For example,if the open side setting is 6 inches,the d80 product size will be 5&#190; inches.
