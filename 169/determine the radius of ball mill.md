## Mill Steel Charge Volume Calculation
We can calculate the steel charge volume of a ball or rod mill and express it as the % of the volume within the liners that is filled with grinding media.While the mill is stopped,the charge volume can be gotten by measuring the diameter inside the liners and the distance from the top of the charge to the top of the mill.AMIT 135: Lesson 7 Ball Mills &amp; Circuits Mining Mill.For overflow ball mills,the charge should not exceed 45% of the mill volume.For grate discharge mills,the charge should occupy about 50% of the mill volume.Bond developed a relationship that can be used to determine the percent charge by volume as a function of t
