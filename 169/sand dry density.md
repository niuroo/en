## Effect of fine particles on strength and stiffness of cement
nbsp 0183 32 Firstly dry sand and kaolin powder are hand mixed and then almost half portion of water is added to the sand kaolin mixture and mixed in a Hobart mixer for 5 min In case of 0 fines only sand and water are mixed for 5 minProctor compaction testnbsp 0183 32 The Proctor compaction test is a laboratory method of experimentally determining the optimal moisture content at which a given soil type will become most dense and achieve its maximum dry density The test is named in honor of Ralph Roscoe Proctor who in 1933 showed that the dry density of a soil for a given compactive effort depends on the amount of water the soil contains during soil
