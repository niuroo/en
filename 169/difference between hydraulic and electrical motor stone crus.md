Hydraulics vs electricsMar 28,2014&#0183;&#32;However,with electric actuation,even super cooled superconducting motors are ultimately limited by their ability to create magnetic fields powerful enough to match hydraulics For instance,one can easily see the potential of hydraulics by considering the Rexroth A2F5 bent axis piston motor,which can output 20 hp,weighs just 55 lbs and can.

Furthermore,the contact angle hysteresis (CAH) is the difference between the advancing (downhill side) and receding (uphill side) contact angles,which is low for Cassie Baxter and high for Wenzel regim As the CAH increases,so does the adhesion strength,which explains the deformed shape of a water droplet adhered to a vertical windowGrinding and Pressing Equipment Cider SchoolHydraulic Presses They are necessary as a cidery scales up,however,as the press tends to be the bottleneck in a cider operation electric grinders and automated washers move much,much faster than a mediocre press does,so investing in a good press is often critical in cideries wanting to increase their speed of juice production
