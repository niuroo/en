## EH 93 4 The Fire Below: Spontaneous Combustion in Coal,
In 1991 at another DOE site,a smoldering fire was discovered in an unused coal bunker which had accumulated 2 cubic feet of coal dust from an overhead coal conveyer system The fire was believed to have started spontaneously,through careless smoking was also listed as a possible cause At still another site,coal stored too long in a silo.Sensor Based Effective Monitoring of Coal Handling,plant Coal has to be transported,via a coal handling system The fuel in a coal fired power plant is stored in silos,bunkers or stock pil Coal is stored in silos in a small plant,Bunkers for handling a day’s operation and Stock piling methods for large plants So,fuel handling had to done efficiently To

## Firefighting foam
nbsp 0183 32 Firefighting foam is a foam used for fire suppression Its role is to cool the fire and to coat the fuel preventing its contact with oxygen resulting in suppression of the combustion Fire fighting foam was invented by the Russian engineer and chemist Aleksandr Loran in 1902 1 The surfactants used must produce foam in concentration of lessCarbon Dioxide (CO2) Fire Suppression System FikeCarbon dioxide or CO 2 is a colorless,odorless,electrically non conductive gas that is highly efficient as a fire suppression agent Fike Carbon Dioxide fire protection systems use intelligent,reliable and fast acting control panels to quickly sense a fire before it can cause damage to property Carbon dioxide gas has a high rate of expansion,which allows a Fike CO,
