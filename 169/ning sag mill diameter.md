## SAG Mill Grinding Circuit Design
SAG is an acronym for semi autogenous grinding.SAG mills are autogenous mills that also use grinding balls like a ball mill.A SAG mill is usually a primary or first stage grinder.SAG mills use a ball charge of 8 to 21%.The largest SAG mill is 42' (12.8m) in diameter,powered by a 28 MW (38,000 HP) motor.Used Mining Equipment SAG MillsWe have 44 years experience designing,manufacturing,installing and commissioning SAG and Ball Mill grinding equipment.We have nearly 30 years experience procuring and re applying used grinding equipment to new mining projects,often with significant lead time and capital co
