13&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Shanghai was formerly a part of Jiangsu province and still shares strong cultural similarities with Jiangsu although mass migration from all across China and the rest of the world has made Shanghai a melting pot of different cultures.Mechanism of water inrush and quicksand.Two sand funnel models and a water inrush outlet model are introduced from which to calculate the flow of the water and quicksand; a comparison of the two shows that the flow predicted by the water inrush outlet model is more consistent with observations from the accident than the sand funnel models.
