## How to grind plastic
We have several machines to grind various polymers into fine powder.By July'19 we will also install our plant for cryogenic fine grinding of difficult polymers like Nylon (Polyamide),PP,PS,ABS.On the similarity of macromolecular responses to. NC State Physicsmolecular weight characteristics of these materials and their designations are listed in Table 1.Milling was conducted at ambient and cryogenic temperatures.(ambimilling and cryomilling,respectively) by placing 3 g of polymer in a hardened steel vial with 30 g of steel ball bearings (6.4 and 7.9 mm in diameter) and sealing.
