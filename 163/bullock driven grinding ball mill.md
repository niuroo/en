## Grinding in Ball Mills: Modeling and Process Control
Grinding in ball mills is an important technological process applied to reduce the size of particles which may have different nature and a wide diversity of physical,mechanical and chemical characteristics.Typical examples are the various ores,minerals,limestoSelection of Comminution Circuits for Improved Efficiencygrinding,to single stage crushing and semi autogenous grinding (SAG) and ball mill (SAB) circuits.This progression has,not necessarily,been accompanied by an.primary mill may be operated in open circuit or closed by a classifier,such as a screen or a hydrocyclone.Closing the primary mill may result in an improvement in
