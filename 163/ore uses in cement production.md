## How Cement Is Made
Common materials used to manufacture cement include limestone,shells,and chalk or marl combined with shale,clay,slate,blast furnace slag,silica sand,and iron ore.These ingredients,when heated at high temperatures form a rock like substance that is ground into the fine powder that we commonly think of as cement.Use of secondary mineralizing raw materials in cement …Use of secondary mineralizing raw materials in cement production.The case study of a stibnite ore By G Kakali,S Tsivilis,K Kolovos,K Choupa,T Perraki,M Perraki,M Stamatakis and Ch Vasilatos Cite BibTex Full citation Abstract It has been found that.
