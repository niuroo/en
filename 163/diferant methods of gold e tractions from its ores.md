## Types of Extraction S cool,the revision website
Methods of extraction Many metals are found in the Earth's crust as ores.An ore is usually a compound of the metal mixed with impurities.When the metal is dug up,a method must be used to separate the metal from the rest of the ore.This is called extracting the.extraction of gold from oresExtraction of Metals Methods of Extraction of Metals Isolation of elements in Chemistry class 12 aims to teach the students about various processes of extraction of metals from ores.Very few metals such as the noble metals,i.e.Gold,Silver,and Platinum etc.are present in their original metallic forms in nature.
