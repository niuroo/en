## Portland Cement (PC) Crown Cement For Solid …
This cement is also called Portland Cement (PC).This is obtained by intimately mixing together calcareous and argillaceous materials,burning them at clinker temperature up to about 1450 degree celsius and grinding the resulting clinker (calcined product) at required fineness and finally mixed with gypsum to obtain cement.Cement Chemistry and Additives SchlumbergerAdditives The raw ingredients of portland cement are ime,si ica,alumina and iron oxide.2 Lime is obtained from ca careous rock deposits and industrial alkali waste.
