## What is the bulk density of aggregate? AnswersDrive
Bulk density of aggregates is the mass of aggregates required to fill the container of a unit volume after aggregates are batched based on volume.It depends on the packing of aggregate i.e.Either loosely packed aggregates or well dense compacted aggregates.Bulk Density Of Aggregates Loose And Compact Bulk.Loose Bulk Density.Loose bulk density can be determined by filling the container with dried aggregates until it overflows from the container.Now level the top surface of container by rolling a rod on it.After that,weight the aggregate mass that is inside the container and divide it by the volume of container.

## Bulk Density of Sand
17&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Density is an important parameter for sand.For sand,density is determined by multiplying the relative density (specific gravity) of the sand times the density of water.Bulk Density of Sand.The bulk density or unit weight of sand is the mass or weight of the sand that required to fill a container of a specified unit volume.Aggregate10&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;high density aggregate.In addition,the relative density of the aggregate is used in calculating the absolute or solid volumes of materials in a concrete mix and thus the yield.The apparent relative density of aggregate generally varies between 2.5 and 3.0.Water absorption The extent to which pores in the aggregate structure can
