## MANUFACTURING OF CEMENT
Manufacture of Cement To manufacture cement first of all limestone is added into the clay in proportion of 3:1 by weight.This mixture of limestone and clay is then dried and crushed to get a fine powder called ‘raw meal’.The raw meal is then added into a rotary kiln through a hopper as shown in figure.Newsroom Limestone and ClayLimestone and Clay.Pre homogenizing Hall Application: The raw materials required to manufacture cement are limestone and clay.Limestone rock extracted from the quarry is taken by truck to the nearby cement plant.The rock from the quarry is routed to a grinding plant where it undergoes initial crushing before being reduced to a fine powder.
