## Controlling foam morphology of polystyrene via …
Abstract.Controlling cell morphologies of polymeric foams is an important part of controlling foam properties.In this study,the effects of particle size,particle content,and particle surface chemistry on cell nucleation in nanosilica polystyrene (PS) composites are investigated.Extrusion of starch based loose fill packaging foams.Starch based loose fill packaging foams were made in a single screw laboratory scale extruder.Corn starch was blended with polystyrene in the ratio of 70 : 30 and extruded into foams using talc and polycarbonate as additives.
