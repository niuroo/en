## How silicon is made
Silicon metal is made from the reaction of silica (silicon dioxide,SiO2) and carbon materials like coke,coal and wood chips.Silica is typically received in the form of metallurgical grade gravel.This gravel is 99.5% silica,and is 3 x 1 or 6 x 1 in (8 x 3 cm or 15 x 3 cm) in size.Contribution of phytoliths to total biogenic silica volumes in.1&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The contribution of phytoliths to total biogenic silica (BSi) volumes in rivers worldwide,and the associated implications for the biogeochemical cycle,require in depth study.Based on samples from rivers in Peninsular Malaysia,this project investigated.
