## Chemical Weathering Processes of Change
Chemical weathering can also result from exposure to water Hydrolysis occurs when silicate minerals react with water so that the mineral recombines with the water molecule to form a new mineralFor example,consider the mineral potassium feldspar Potassium feldspar is a fairly common mineral and can be found in igneous,metamorphic and,Karst WikipediaKarst is a topography formed from the dissolution of soluble rocks such as limestone,dolomite,and gypsum It is characterized by underground drainage systems with sinkholes and caves [1] It has also been documented for more weathering resistant rocks,such as quartzite,given the right conditions [2]

## Weathering and Soils Tulane University
Chemical Weathering Since many rocks and minerals are formed under conditions present deep within the Earth,when they arrive near the surface as a result of uplift and erosion,they encounter conditions very different,How Does Weathering Affect Limestone? …Limestone is a sedimentary rock created from the remains of dead sea creatures and is predominately made up of calcium carbonate.Many horizontal and vertical cracks run through limestone.These cracks allow water to pass easily through the rock.Water acts as an acid when it contacts calcium carbonate,dissolving the limestone.
