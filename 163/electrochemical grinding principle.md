## Module 3: ADVANCED MATERIAL REMOVAL PROCESSES nptel
Electro chemical grinding (ECG) is a variant process of the basic ECM.It is a burr free and stress free material removal process,wherein material removal of the electrically conductive material takes place through mechanical (grinding) process and electro chemical process.The abrasive laden grinding wheel is negatively&nbsp;.What is Electrochemical Honing?Most of the times electrochemical honing is often termed as the ECH.This process is quite familiar to the electrochemical grinding in which we us the hone tool instead of the grinding wheel.Do you know the process of honing? Honing is a machining process in which a hone tool is used.

## Electrochemical Grinding Process Overview
Electrochemical Grinding (ECG) Process Overview Electrochemical Grinding,or ECG,is a variation of ECM (Electrochemical Machining) that combines electrolytic activity with the physical removal of material by means of charged grinding wheels.Electrochemical Grinding (ECG) can produce burr free and stress free parts&nbsp;.Deburring and electro chemical Deburring EMAG Machine ToolsContactless deburring with ECM electro chemical machining: It is fair to describe the precision deburring or burnishing of metal components using the electro chemical machining (ECM) process as economically highly viable.

## What is Electrochemical Grinding and How it Works.
What is Electrochemical Grinding? It is a process that is quite similar to the electrochemical machining.As per the name,it is the metal removal process which is nothing but the combination of the grinding process and electrochemical process.It is also termed as the “electrolytic grinding…Electrochemical Grinding Principleelectrochemical grinding electrochemical grinding ecg is a particular type of electrochemical machining in which a rotating grinding wheel with a conductive bond material is used to augment the anodic dissolution of the metal workpart surface,as illustrated in the below figure 2.Read More; The Basic Principle Of The Grinding Process
