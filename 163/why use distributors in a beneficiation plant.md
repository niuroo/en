## What Is Coal Preparation? Energy
What Is Coal Preparation? • Coal preparation is the removal of undesirable material from the Run of Mine (ROM) coal by employing separation processes which are able to differentiate between the physical and surface properties of the coal and the impuriti Through coal preparation,a uniform product is achievedPhosphate Beneficiation ArrMazDuring phosphate beneficiation,producers use ArrMaz’s anionic flotation reagents to selectively separate the desired phosphate from the gangue with a focus on maximizing the amount of phosphate recovery possible Just as each phosphate deposit is unique in composition,so too are ArrMaz’s flotation reagents
