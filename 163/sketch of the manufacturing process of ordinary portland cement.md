## Cement and Concrete Composites
Raw material including ordinary Portland cement (P&#183;O 42.5R) and silica fume (SF) are used as the binding materials.In the manufacturing process,copper slag,cement,silica sand,silica.Types and Causes of Concrete Deterioration14&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The exceptional durability of portland cement concrete is a major reason why it is the world’s most widely used construction material.But material limitations,design and construction practices,and severe exposure conditions can cause concrete to deteriorate,which may result in aesthetic,functional,or structural problems.

## Concrete Production
Portland cement itself is a complex material,manufactured by first burning an intimate mixture of limestone and clay or shale in a kiln at temperatures in the range of 1400&#176;C 1500&#176;C,and then intergrinding the resulting clinker with a small amount of gypsum.Concrete production is a highly intensive energy consuming process and.Manufacture of Ordinary Portland CementCement is a hydraulic binder and is defined as a finely ground inorganic material which,when mixed with water,forms a paste which sets and hardens by means of hydration reactions and processes which,after hardening retains it's strength and stability even under water.Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) is one of several types of cement being manufactured throughout the world,listed in table.

## concrete Definition,Composition,Uses,&amp; Facts …
Concrete is characterized by the type of aggregate or cement used,by the specific qualities it manifests,or by the methods used to produce it.In ordinary structural concrete,the character of the concrete is largely determined by a water to cement ratio.The lower the water content,all else being equal,the stronger the concrete.How Portland Cement is Made? Manufacturing …Portland cement can be made by following two different processes a dry one and a wet one.Joseph Aspdin first made portland cement in his kitchen stove in England in the 19th century.Lime and silica make up approximately 85% of portland cement.The materials that are commonly used are limestone,shells,chalk,shale,clay,slate,silica sand,and iron ore.Since limestone is the main.
