## Sandstone Minerals Education Coalition
Sandstone is a sedimentary rock composed mostly of quartz sand,but it can also contain significant amounts of feldspar,and sometimes silt and clay.Sandstone that contains more than 90% quartz is called quartzose sandstone.When the sandstone contains more than 25% feldspar,it is called arkose or arkosic sandstone.Feldspar Minerals Education CoalitionOn those elements we can distinguish three families: Feldspathic sand,Pegmatite and Feldspar.A further distinction can be made between sodium,potassium and mixed feldspars,depending on the type of alkali they contain.Feldspars play an important role as fluxing agents in ceramics and glass applications,and also are used as functional.
