## Ecotoxicity of Mercury Contaminated Sediment,
The quality of Hg contaminated sediments in artisanal gold mining areas of Tanzania have to date only been assessed through bulk chemical analysis However,measurement of contaminant levels alone has a limited ability to predict adverse effects on living resourc In this study we investigated the possible effects of Hg contaminated,Impact of gold mining associated with mercury,The mercury level in the lichens (Table 1) in this area is about seven times higher than those (100 310 μg kg −1) recorded near the goldmines in Mugusu in the Geita Forest Reserve in Tanzania (Ikingura and Akagi 2002),but are lower than the values recorded in the Tarakwa gold mining area (Ghana),whose average values fell within the 160.
