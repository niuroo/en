## Grinding in Ball Mills: Modeling and Process Control
Grinding in ball mills is an important technological process applied to reduce the.(feeders),and the system for discharging the output product.The size of a mill is usually characterized by the.continuous steady state mills,the size reduction is treated as a continuous process.Dry Grinding Attritors: Continuous Production Mills.The HSA High Speed Attritor is generally used in a continuous mode.The material is charged into the mill at the top and is discharged out the bottom side,making use of centrifugal force.The HSA is used when smaller particle size (generally 40 mesh) materials are fed into the machine and micron size end product is desired.
