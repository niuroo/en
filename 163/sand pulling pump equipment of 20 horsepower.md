## Pumping Water
14&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Example Horsepower Required to Pump Water.20 gallons of water per minute is elevated 20 ft.The horsepower required (ex.friction loss in piping and efficiency = 1.0) can be calculated as.P whp = (20 gpm) (20 ft) (1) (3960 (1.0)) = 0.10 hp.Power required to pump water at 60 o F with ideal pump efficiency 1.0:Pool Pump Problems14&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Without a pump to circulate the water,hot weather will turn it bad quick.If your pump is down,lower the pH to 7.2,and shock the pool.Brush and skim twice daily to try and keep it clean and circulated.The pool pump is the workhorse of the equipment pad pulling the water from the pool and pushing it through your filter and heater.
