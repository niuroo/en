## Basic Layout and Working of a Thermal Power Plant.
17&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Coal: In a coal based thermal power plant,coal is transported from coal mines to the generating station.Generally,bituminous coal or brown coal is used as fuel.The coal is stored in either 'dead storage' or in 'live storage'.Dead storage is generally 40 days backup coal storage which is used when coal supply is unavailable.Natural gas power plant24&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Natural gas power plants generate electricity by burning natural gas as their fuel.There are many types of natural gas power plants which all generate electricity,but serve different purposes.All natural gas plants use a gas turbine; natural gas is added,along with a stream of air,which combusts and expands through this turbine causing a generator to spin a magnet,making electricity.
