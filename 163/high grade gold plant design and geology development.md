## Ore Grade
Underground mine development costs considerably more than open pit mine development,per annual tonne of mined ore.This,and the high cost of operating underground explain why underground ore bodies must contain (a) higher ore grade than open pit ore bodies and or (b) valuable byproducts such as Ag,Au,Co,Mo,and Ni.The process design of gold leaching and carbon in pulp.27&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;gold plant will be that of the leaching and carbon in pulp circuit (CIP).The reagent and.a small volume of solution with a high gold concentration.The gold is recovered from this solution by electrowinning.22 2 The process design of gold leaching and carbon in pulp circuits
