It is in the blast furnace that extraction of iron occurs.The extraction of iron from its ore is a long and subdued process,that helps in separating the useful components from the waste materials such as slag.What happens in the Blast Furnace? The purpose of a Blast Furnace is to reduce the concentrated ore chemically to its liquid metal state.Copper mining.The main stages.2014 6 13&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Copper minerals and ore are found throughout the Earth's crust.They occur in both sedimentary and igneous rocks.The outer 10km of the crust contains 33g of copper for every tonne of rock.This is not enough to make it commercially viable to extract the rock.
