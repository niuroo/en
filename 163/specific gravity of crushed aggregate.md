## Determining the specific gravities of coarse …
The current method of specific gravity and absorption of coarse aggregate testing is based on the AASHTO T 85 and ASTM C standards.This approach involves the soaking of the coarse aggregate samples for 15h (AASHTO T 85) and 24 &#177; 4 h (ASTM C ),and drying the aggregate to its saturated surface dry (SSD) state with the aid of a dry absorbent cloth.What is bulk density of cement,aggregate,sand?Bulk density is the mass of a unit volume of material in its natural state(with pores and voids).For cement (portland cement) : density (2.3.1 g cm^3) For sand.

## Fine Aggregate Specific Gravity
19&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Overview.The fine aggregate specific gravity test (Figure 1) is used to calculate the specific gravity of a fine aggregate sample by determining the ratio of the weight of a given volume of aggregate to the weight of an equal volume of water.It is similar in nature to the coarse aggregate specific gravity test.Figure 1: Fine aggregate specific gravity sample and pycnometer.Coarse Aggregate Specific Gravity4&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Specific Gravity The specific gravity (relative density) of an aggregate is the ratio of its weight to the weight of an equal volume of water.Most natural aggregates have specific gravities between 2.4 and 3.0 as shown in the next slide.Concrete Technology 26 Specific Gravity of Rock Groups •Rock Group •Average Specific •Gravity

## ASTM D6473
The specific gravity may be expressed as bulk specific gravity or apparent specific gravity.Bulk specific gravity and absorption are based on a 24 &#177; h soaking time for the rock specimens tested.This test is appropriate for breakwater stone,armor stone,riprap,and gabion sized rock materials.“Effect of Specific Gravity on Aggregate Varies the Weight.23&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;dimensionless.The specific gravity of an aggregate is considered to be a measure of strength or quality of the material.The specify gravity test helps in identification of stone.The specific gravity of aggregates ranges from 2.5 to 3.0.Specific Gravity is the ratio of the weight of a given volume of
