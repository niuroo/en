## Concrete
Concrete is a composite material composed of fine and coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement (cement paste) that hardens (cures) over time.In the past limebased cement binders were often used,such as lime putty,but sometimes with other hydraulic cements,such as a calcium aluminate cement or with Portland cement to form Portland cement concrete (for its visual resemblance to.What are the Proper Concrete Mix Proportions?Concrete is the single most important material in modern building and concrete mix proportions are the most important aspects of working with concrete.Without concrete,residential homes and commercial skyscrapers fall,bridges have no anchors,piers or abutments,tunnels,sidewalks,curbs,sewer systems… concrete is — literally — the foundation of development.
