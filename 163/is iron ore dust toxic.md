## Genesis,Uses and Environment Implications of Iron Oxides …
Beneficiation processes of iron ore generate dust in the atmosphere,acid mine drainage in the ecosystem and metallic iron for steelmaking.The main sources of air contamination during the beneficiation processes are emission of poisonous gases such as nitrous oxide,carbon dioxide,carbon monoxide and sulfur dioxide.Stone coldPyrite,which is a sulphide mineral composed of iron and sulphur,is a major contaminator of ground water and streams due to acid mine drainage from sulphide mine tailings.Oxidation of pyrite releases toxic metals and metalloids such as Arsenic (As),which is
