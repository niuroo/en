## Iron Ore Pellet
Today iron ore agglomeration is the largest tonnage application for sintering,with plants operating at up 20,000 metric tonnes per day.For example,Figure 2.14 is a picture of a modern agglomeration facility which incorporates off gas capture to reduce environmental damage.In such a facility,the iron ore fines are mixed with fluxes,carbon fuel,and water.ESCO Corporation Cone Crusher Wear PartsESCO supplies replacement wear parts to fit all major cone crusher models including the new highhorsepower crushers ESCO cone crusher wear parts are engineered to maximize production by retaining the feed opening throughout the part’s lifespan and balancing the mantle and bowl liner wear

## How is Iron Made Into Steel? Sciencing
Iron was the dominant metal for use in building and machinery until the modern era.Iron is still the main component of steel but when impurities are removed in the steel making process,a stronger,lighter material results (steel).Steel is used in almost all modern buildings,automobiles,aircraft and appliances.Heat Treatment of Cast Irons16&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;form iron is lustrous,silvery,soft,and ductile.However,pure iron is a poor engineering material,generally not as strong as most plastics.Cast irons are based on the Fe C system,and the solid state transformations on which cast iron heat treatments are based are similar to those applied to steels.Heat Treatment of Cast Irons

## Introduction to Iron ore Pellets and Pelletizing …
Pelletizing is a process which involves mixing of very finely ground particles of iron ore fines having a size which is less than 200 mesh (0.074 mm) with additives like bentonite and then shaping them into near oval spherical balls having size in the range of 8 mm to 16 mm in diameter by a pelletizer and hardening the balls by firing with a fuel.iron ore pelletsurface hardeningiron ore pelletsurface hardening HEAT TREATMENT OF IRON ORE AGGLOMERATES,In this study,heat treatment of iron ore agglomerates with microwave energy is investigated First drying and then heat hardening tests were performed Two Metal Crusher Unit Of China heat treatment of iron ore agglomerates withmicrowave energy
