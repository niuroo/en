Even though sand is made of rock fragments,its density is less because the porosity of sand lowers its bulk density (as shown below).(Note that the negative exponent in the units cubic centimeters indicates a reciprocal.Thus 1 cm 3 = 1 cm 3 and the units for our densities could be written as g cm 3,or g cm 3.Weights of Various Construction Materials8&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Most gravel products will weight approximately 2,840 pounds per cubic yard or about 1.42 tons per cubic yard.For most estimating purposes,consider the yield to be 3,000 pounds per cubic yard or 1.5 tons per cubic yard.
