19&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Coal washing Coal that comes from a mine is a complex mixture of materials with a large variety of physical properties.In addition to the coal itself,pieces of rock,sand,and various minerals are contained in the mixture.Thus,before coal can be sold to consumers,it must be cleaned.The cleaning process consists of a number of steps that results in a product that is specifically suited to.Waste from the coal extraction process as raw material …15&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;In this work the feasibility of utilization of waste originating during the coal extraction process as raw material for the construction industry is studied.During the process,the gross coal extracted from the mine is sent to a purification station and put on a vibrating sieve where particles bigger than 150 mm are separated to be milled.

## Recovery of Cenospheres and Magnetite from Coal …
electric energy by burning coal in the so called carbo electric power plants.The most important waste material from the carbo electric plants is fly ash (the non combustible part of the coal that is carried away with the combustion gases).Fly ash is usually trapped in the electrostaticCoal Beneficiation an overview ScienceDirect TopicsCoal preparation,or beneficiation,is a series of operations that remove mineral matter (ie,ash) from coal Preparation relies on different mechanical operations,which will not be discussed in detail,to perform the separation,such as size reduction,size classification,cleaning,dewatering and drying,waste disposal,and pollution control

## Waste Coal Fact Sheet v2 Energy Justice
Waste coal ash is dumped in communities not far from the waste coal burners,threatening the groundwater and nearby rivers and streams Waste coal ash does far more damage than unburned waste coal piles,leaching many pollutants,including aluminum,arsenic,cadmium,chromium,iron,lead,manganese,molybdenum,nickel,selenium and sulfatMagnetite Uses Uses Of MagnetiteMagnetite being magnetic in nature can easily be scavenged back after the filtering process from the waste water streams.Another important use of magnetite is its use in the heavy media process in coal mining.Magnetite can be added to water in the form of a very fine powder to create heavy media slurry that has a higher specific gravity than.
