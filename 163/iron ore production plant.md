## Direct Reduced Iron and its Production Processes …
Major DRI production processes are either gas based or coal based.Feed material in a DRI process is either iron ore sized to 10 to 30mm or iron ore pellets produced in an iron ore pellet plant.In the gas based plant the reactor,the reduction reaction takes place is a shaft furnace.Iron Ore PelletToday iron ore agglomeration is the largest tonnage application for sintering,with plants operating at up 20,000 metric tonnes per day.For example,Figure 2.14 is a picture of a modern agglomeration facility which incorporates off gas capture to reduce environmental damage.In such a facility,the iron ore fines are mixed with fluxes,carbon fuel,and water.
