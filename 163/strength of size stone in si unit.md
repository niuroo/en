## Yield Strength
Yield Strength definition,equation and related strength of materials.Yield Strength Strength ( Mechanics ) of Materials.Strength Mechanics of Materials.A number of terms have been defined for the purpose of identifying the stress at which plastic deformation begins.The value most commonly used for this purpose is the yield strength.What Is Ultimate Tensile Strength? &#187; Science ABC18&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Ultimate tensile strength unit.Tensile strength is defined as a measurement of stress,which,in turn,is measured as force per unit area.The SI unit of UTS is Pascal or Pa.It’s usually expressed in megaPascals,so the UTS is commonly expressed in megaPascals (or MPa).In the US,the UTS is often expressed in pounds per square inch (or psi).

## Engineering Properties of Stones and Tests on Stones.
The more compact grained and heavier a stone the harder it is.Due to alternate wetting and drying the resulting crushing strength can be reduced even up to 40%.Being dry stones allow more crushing strength than when wet.It is the ability of a stone to endure and maintain its essential and distinctive characteristics i.e.resistance to decay,strength andTests on Building Stones18&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Crushing strength of the stone per unit area is the maximum load at which the sample crushes or fails divided by the area of the bearing face of the specimen.Crystalline Test on Building Stone.At least four cubes of stone with side as 40mm are taken.They are dried for 72 hrs and weighed.They are then immersed in 14% solution of Na2SO4 for 2.

## Compressive strength of rocks
Estimating compressive strength.General rock failure criterion can be reduced to a few parameters dependent on lithology (m) and the uniaxial compressive strength (C 0).Lithology is commonly derived during log analysis,so m may be estimated (Table 1).What is needed still is an initial measure of rock strength provided by C 0.C 0 can be estimated from porosity or sonic velocities,but many.Structural Use of Unreinforced Masonry23&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;strength of masonry.(b) Permissible strength in shear has been modified to include shear strength corresponding to all likely failure modes.(c) Some new definitions have been added and ‘pier’ and ‘pillaster’ have been re defined.(d) Some general guidelines for the proper selection of the mortar have been given.
