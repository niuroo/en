## What Is Nickel Smelting? (with picture) wisegeek
Jan 15,2019&#0183;&#32;Nickel smelting is the process that nickel ore goes through to eventually remove impurities and leave just the nickel metal While the ores can come from different stones and sources,they have two categories: lateritic,or rocks found in tropical climates and which contain nickel; and sulfidic ore,which is mined from undergroundnickel ore mineral processing procedure whitehillstreeNickel processing,preparation of the metal for use in various products,(crushing This is usually the initial step in the smelting process The ore concentrate is Copper Nickel Flotation 911 Metallurgist Jun 15,2017 Laboratory Copper Nickel Ore Flotation,process flowsheet development for beneficiation of nickel ore A.
