## What are the lumps of minerals found on the ocean …
22&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Known as manganese nodules right now there is a lot of concern about ownership of the ocean floor because of the wealth to be had from mining nodules.Interesting aside? The core of a nodule is often a shark's tooth,small shell or other critter remnant which gives a clue to their accretionary history.Manganese: applications and uses MetalpediaManganese sulphate is widely used as an end product in fertilizers and animal feed,and as an intermediate product in the chemical industry.An organic manganese compound called MMT (methylcyclo pentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl) has been used as an octane booster or anti knock agent in unleaded gasoline.
