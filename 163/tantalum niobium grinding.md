## Machining Tantalum
There are many uses of Tantalum metal and below are details on machining Tantalum including welding,grinding,spinning and more!.Turning and Milling.In lathe operations,cemented carbide tools with high cutting speeds should be used.The tools should be kept sharp and ground with as much positive rake as the tool can withstand.Tantalum Niobium Commerce ResourcesMetallurgical testwork shows that the ferrocolumbite and pyrochlore which host the tantalum and niobium mineralization are amenable to a two stage process of conventional flotation and proven refining processes with estimated recoveries of 65% to 70%.The first step of the process uses grinding followed by flotation to produce a concentrate.

## Niobium Mining,Techniques,Mines,Occurence,…
Niobium mostly occurs as an oxide and in combination with tantalum.The niobium ore is generally mined by the open pit method,where it is divided into blocks and processed by ripping,bulldozing,loading,and transporting.Most commercial extraction and refining processes for the preparation of niobium consist of a series of progressive operations which involves production of ferroniobium and.Tantalum and Niobium Mining SGS South AfricaTantalum and niobium processing can be difficult because the minerals are brittle,heavy and typically highly intergrown with sulfide and other oxide minerals.SGS has contributed to many tantalum projects over the years and can bring an integrated suite of services to tantalum and niobium exploration or development projects.Mineralogy
