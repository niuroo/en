spent gold bearing alloys coming from the electronic industry,jewelry,and dentistry sectors.2 All the hydrometal lurgical gold extraction routes utilize a leaching step to produce a gold bearing solution as an intermediate product while the recycling of secondaryBioleaching WikipediaThe leaching of CuFeS 2 follows the two stages of being dissolved and then further oxidised,with Cu 2+ ions.the sole purpose of the bacterial step is the regeneration.Treating the mixture with sodium cyanide in the presence of free oxygen dissolves the gold.The gold is removed from the solution by adsorbing (taking it up.
