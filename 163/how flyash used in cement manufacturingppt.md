## US8357239B2 Treatment of fly ash for use in concrete,
A process for treating fly ash to render it highly usable as a concrete additive A quantity of fly ash is obtained that contains carbon and which is considered unusable fly ash for concrete based upon foam index testing The fly ash is mixed with a quantity of spray dryer ash (SDA) and water to initiate a geopolymerization reaction and form a geopolymerized fly ash(PDF) Contribution of Fly ash to the properties of Mortar …Fly ash was first used in large scale in the construction of Hungry Horse dam in America in the approximate amount of 30 per cent by weight of cement.Later on it was used …

## FLY ASH CONCRETE
Fly ash concrete has many benefits over regular concrete like improved strength,durability,more chemical resistant,less segregation,easier to pump,improved workability,and less water needed.Hi,I am Mike Day,owner of Day’s Concrete Floors,Inc.in Maine,where I've been working with concrete for 30 years now,and this website is where I can share with you all the knowledge and wisdom.(PDF) Replacement of Cement by Fly Ash in ConcreteDifferent concrete mixes with varying fly ash content percentage were produced,replacing 0% (reference concrete),15%,25%,35%,45%,55% and 65% cement in terms of weight For compressive.
