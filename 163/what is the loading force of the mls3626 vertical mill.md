## Ball Mills vs Rod Mills
10&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;When the mill is rotated without feed or with very fine feed,the rods are in parallel alignment and in contact with one another for their full length.New feed entering at one end of the mill causes the rod charge to spread at that end.This produces a series of wedge shaped slots tapering toward the discharge end.The tumbling and rolling rods expend most of their crushing force on the.Vertical Grinding Has Advantages : Modern Machine …In vertical grinding,the workpiece is held upright in a rotary chuck with the grinding spindle overhead.This configuration can improve roundness,facilitate single setup processing and prolong the life of the machine.Loading and unloading may gets easier,too.Workpieces with relatively large diameters and short lengths benefit the most from vertical grinding.&gt;

## Ball Mills
The vertical mill has a proven track record in grinding blastfurnace slag,where it has the additional advantage of being a much more effective drier of wet feedstock than a ball mill.The vertical mill is more complex but its installation is more compact.The relative ‘installed’ capital costs tend to be site specific.Raymond Bartlett Snow Milling Technologies Specialized …28&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The Roller Mill is an air swept vertical ring roll with an integral classification system.A vertical shaft rotates a “spider” assembly of arms from which are suspended free swinging journal assemblies with rolls attached.As the unit turns,centrifugal force drives the rolls against the inner vertical surface of the grinding ring.
