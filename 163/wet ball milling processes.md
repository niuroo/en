## Synthesis of Nanomaterials by High Energy Ball Milling
17&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;For all nanocrystalline materials prepared by high energy ball milling synthesis route,surface and interface contamination is a major concern.In particular,mechanical attributed contamination by the milling tools (Fe or WC) as well as ambient gas (trace impurities such as O 2,N 2 in rare gases) can be problems for high energy ball milling.Grinding in Ball Mills: Modeling and Process Control10&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;the milling process takes place during rotation as a result of the transfer of kinetic energy of the moving grinding media into the grinding product.The design of a ball mill can vary significantly depending on the size,the equipment used to load the starting material (feeders),and the system for discharging the output product.
