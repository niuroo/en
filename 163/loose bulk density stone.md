## Bulk Density and Void Percentage Test for Aggregates
The bulk density and void percentage of aggregate can be evaluated using standard test methods of applicable codes such as ASTM C 29 C29M a,IS: 2386 (Part 3) 1963,or BS 2:1995.The procedure provided in this article is based on the specification of.ASTM C29 C29M1.1 This test method covers the determination of bulk density (“unit weight”) of aggregate in a compacted or loose condition,and calculated voids between particles in fine,coarse,or mixed aggregates based on the same determination.This test method is applicable
