## The Basics of Milling Lumber
15&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Synopsis: Successful furniture making relies on starting with boards that are flat,straight,and square.Since lumber doesn’t come that way,you have to make it so.Bob Van Dyke employs a strategic approach to milling that starts with the jointer,moves to the planer,returns to the jointer,and ends at the tablesaw.The Fundamentals of CNC Milling and Turning RapidCNC milling and turning are two subtractive machining techniques which are controlled by numerical control (NC) code.When we receive your model,it gets converted into a series of codes that precisely control the cutter in order to form your part from solid bars or rods of metal or plastic.
