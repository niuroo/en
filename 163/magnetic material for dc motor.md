## What is a commutator?
The operating principle of a DC motor is based on the interaction between the magnetic field of a rotating armature and the magnetic field of a fixed stator.As the north pole of the armature is attracted to the south pole of the stator (and vice versa),a force is produced on the armature,causing it to turn.Construction of a DC GeneratorConstruction of a DC Generator A DC Generator is an electrical device which converts mechanical energy into electrical energy.It mainly consists of three main parts,i.e.Magnetic field system,Armature and Commutator and Brush gear.
