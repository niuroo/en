## How to Calculate 3 Phase Motor Power Consumption …
Calculate three phase motor power consumption by multiplying amps by volts by the square root of three (W = AV(sqrt 3).For example,if the motor is drawing 30 amps at 250 volts,you have 30 x 250 x sqrt 3 (about 1.73) = 12,975 watts).Convert watts to kilowatts by dividing the number of watts by 1,000.How can I measure the energy consumption in CNC …How can I measure the energy consumption in CNC machines without using Energy (Power) Analyzer instrument?.ResearchGate's Q&amp;A forum is where you ask technical questions and get answers from.
