The state of the mines which boomed throughout the United Kingdom during the industrial revolution is a passionately argued area.It is very hard to generalize about the living and working conditions experienced in mines,as there was great regional variation and some owners acted paternalistically while others were cruel.The Story of Coal The View from the MountainIn 1842 a UK Royal Commission was established to look into child labour conditions in the rapidly expanding coal industry.Many young boys would start employment at 8 10 years old,opening and closing doors within the pit for wagons for 8—12 hours a day (with a half hour break for breakfast &amp; another half hour for dinner),6 days a week.
