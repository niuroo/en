## How does chloride affect the properties of concrete? ,
Chloride attack is one of the most important aspects for consideration when we deal with the durability of concrete Chloride attack is particularly important because it primarily causes corrosion of reinforcement Statistics have indicated that over 40 per cent of failure of structures is due to.What are the disadvantages of using calcium chloride in,Answer (1 of 3): I won’t say that it is a kind of disadvantage Calcium chloride acts as a accelerator in the concrete Low temperatures slow concrete hydration That is why an accelerator is needed to obtain high initial strength The use of calcium chloride assists in reaching the concrete's de.

## Evaluation of Chloride Limits for Reinforced,
The total chloride content in a concrete mixture can be estimated when the mixture proportions are being developed for the project This involves calculating the total chloride content based on measuredChloride Induced Corrosion of Reinforcement,The chloride distributions along the concrete steel interface and possible differences between passive and active regions were studied,for different steel surface conditions under free corrosion conditions as well as under potentiostatic control

## Testing Chloride Penetration Resistance of Concrete
8&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;by using relatively impenetrable concrete.The ability of chloride ions to penetrate the concrete must then be known for design as well as quality control purposes.The penetration of the concrete by chloride ions,however,is a slow process.It cannot be determined directly in a time frame that would be useful as a quality control measure.Rapid Chloride PermeabilityTestingified concrete mix,a chloride perme ability reduction of 56% is obtained At AMEC,we tested concrete sam ples from a bridge deck rehabilitation project in Vancouver where a maxi mum of 1000 coulombs passed at 28 days was specified The samples were,Rapid Chloride Permeability Test: 4 6.

## Corrosion of Embedded Materials PCA
The intrusion of chloride ions,present in deicing salts and seawater,into reinforced concrete can cause steel corrosion if oxygen and moisture are also available to sustain the reaction Chlorides dissolved in water can permeate through sound concrete or reach the steel through cracks Chloride containing admixtures can also cause corrosionConcrete WikipediaConcrete,usually Portland cement concrete,is a composite material composed of fine and coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement (cement paste),Sporosarcina pasteurii reduces water and chloride permeability B pasteurii increases resistance to ac

13&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;ADVERTISEMENTS: White dealing with the durability aspect of concrete,the chloride effect on concrete is the most impor&#173;tant factor as it causes the corrosion of reinforcement of concrete.The statistical studies have shown that more than 40% structures have failed due to the corrosion of reinforcement steel.Due to high alkaline nature of calcium hydroxide …Determination of the concrete chloride diffusion.13&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The chloride diffusion coefficient is an indication of the capacity of any type of concrete to resist chloride penetration and is used to predict the service life of reinforced concrete structures.Its determination has been subject of intense study in the last 50 years and today there is no complete agreement in the methodologies used.
