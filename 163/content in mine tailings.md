## Weir Minerals provides insight into mine dewatering …
The foremost benefit of dewatering tailings is the reduction of water that needs to be transported from a process plant to a tailings storage facility (TSF).Reduced water content means tailings slurry volume is decreased,allowing for smaller pipelines and pumping equipment to be used.This can also minimise power requirements.From Tailings to Treasure? Miners Make Money …New technology allows it to recover up to 40% of the gold left in particle form in tailings.DRD Gold extracted 33,600 ounces of gold,worth nearly US$40 million,in the last quarter of 2013.Mintails,a mine tailings processor,has developed new technology to process 350,000 tons of slimes from its extensive tailings resources.

## Tailings
2&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Paste tailings is a modification to the conventional methods of disposal of tailings (pond storage).Conventional tailings slurries are composed of a low percent of solids and relatively high water content (normally ranging from 20% to 60% solids for most hard rock mining) and when deposited into the tailings pond the solids and liquids separate.Mine Tailings Dean Carter Binational Center for.14&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Dust from mine tailings can affect human health due to its physical characteristics (e.g.small particles are more efficiently inhaled and deposited into the lungs) and because it might contain a number of potentially hazard ous substances.Certain contaminants are more soluble in human fluids and available for absorption by the body.

11&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Dewatering tailings to higher degrees than paste produces a filtered wet (saturated) and dry (unsaturated) cake that can no longer be transported by pipeline due to its low moisture content.These filtered tailings are normally transported by conveyor or truck,deposited,spread and compacted to form an unsaturated tailings deposit (Davies and.TailingsTailings storage is one of the biggest design decisions in the development of a mine.There are many factors which need to be considered in selecting the optimum site and construction method.Site conditions such as topography,rainfall,seismic activity,mineral characteristics and proximity to people dictate appropriate tailings sites.
