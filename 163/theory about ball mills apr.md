## Ball Mill Grinding Theory
17&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;In connection with this,I wish two further points had been gone into as thoroughly: (1) The effect of the quality of classification.In general,it is true that the smaller the per cent,of undersize in the feed the more effective is the mill’s work.This is true on a bucking board,in tube mills,ball mills…Mill (grinding)SAG is an acronym for semi autogenous grinding.SAG mills are autogenous mills that also use grinding balls like a ball mill.A SAG mill is usually a primary or first stage grinder.SAG mills use a ball charge of 8 to 21%.The largest SAG mill is 42' (12.8m) in diameter,powered by a 28 MW (38,000 HP) motor.
