## How to calculate torque value to axial force
Torque is calculated only for rotating body,Torque for axial force be zero Torque = Force * Perpendicular distance Torque = Force * 0 (The perpendicular distance between the forceTheoretical analysis and experiment of pressure …&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;The screw conveyor is an important component of the earth pressure balanced shield machine and bears the heavy responsibility of “soil discharge,pressure holding and pressure regulation.
