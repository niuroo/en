The ball and tube mills are low speed machines that grind the coal with steel balls in a rotating horizontal cylinder.Due to its shape,it is called a tube mill and due to use of grinding balls for crushing,it is called a ball mill,or both terms as a ball tube mill.These mills are also designated as an example size‚Ä¶Cement millBall mills are normally operated at around 75% of critical speed,so a mill with diameter 5 metres will turn at around 14 rpm.The mill is usually divided into at least two chambers (although this depends upon feed input size mills including a roller press are mostly single chambered),allowing the use of different sizes of grinding media.
