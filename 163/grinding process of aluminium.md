## New Ways in Aluminium Alloys Grinding
This paper deals with new possibilities in aluminium alloys grinding.Presently the aluminium alloys have forceful usage in engineering.The using of aluminium alloys we can find in general engineering,automotive industry,cosmonautics,aeronautics and medicine.Wide possibilities of the aluminium alloys using is very important area for production technology too.Metallographic grinding and polishing insight …Fine grinding produces a surface with little deformation that can easily be removed during polishing.Because of the drawbacks with grinding papers,alternative fine grinding composite surfaces are available,in order to improve and facilitate fine grinding,A high material removal rate is obtained by using grain sizes of 15,9.0 and 6.0 &#181;m.
