## Fine grinding in a horizontal ball mill
Because of this,grinding below 25 μm in a horizontal ball mill is not practicable.The aim of this experimental work was to study the effect of ball size on the feed and product size distributions in a ball mill fine grinding situation.2.Mill feed ball size distributionModeling ball impact on the wet mill liners and its.1.Introduction.In a horizontal ball mill,particle size reduction is achieved by rubbing or impacting heavy masses in the rotating cylinder.Those masses,consisting of ore particles and grinding balls,either cascade down the surface or fall (cataract) through the free space onto the material or,under certain circumstances,onto the mill liners.

## Ball mill liner
In order to make the ball mill Liners easy to move on the shell plates without any change,the design and construction of lifter bars should be carefully and precisely,and for this purpose it is necessary to easily lifter bars outlast lifter bars by two to one.Ball millA ball mill,a type of grinder,is a cylindrical device used in grinding (or mixing) materials like ores,chemicals,ceramic raw materials and paints.Ball mills rotate around a horizontal axis,partially filled with the material to be ground plus the grinding medium.Different materials are used as media,including ceramic balls,flint pebbles and stainless steel balls.
