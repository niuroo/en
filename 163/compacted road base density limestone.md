## Why 95% Compaction Geotechnical engineering general,
29 03 2004&#0183;&#32;When dealing with compaction testing and acceptance criteria,you really need to keep the idea of the statistical density of a compacted fill based on the testing done That is,if you get some higher than the specified relative compaction (or relative density in some cases) results and some lower,use of engineering judgement is of great importance when accepting,
