## Mineral dressing (= Orebeneficiation)
16&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Mineral dressing (= Orebeneficiation) The first process most ores undergo after they leave the mine is mineral dressing (processing),also called ore preparation,milling,and ore dressing or ore beneficiation.Ore dressing is a process of mechanically separating the grains of ore minerals from the gangue minerals,to produce a concentrate.Free Powerpoint Intro To Mineral ProcessingFree Powerpoint Intro To Mineral Processing; MINE 292 Introduction to Mineral Processing Lecture 2.MINE 292 Introduction to Mineral Processing Lecture 2 A free PowerPoint PPT presentation (displayed as a Flash slide show) on PowerShow id: 1bdcbb ZDc1Z
