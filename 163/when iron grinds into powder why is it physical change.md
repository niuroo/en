## Physical and Chemical Changes
Acting upon matter can cause it to change,but it is useful to separate these changes into two different categories: physical and chemical.A chemical change describes a process that changes one material into another.Burning wood causes it to turn into ash,a different material.A physical change is simply changing the shape or state,such as cutting a piece of wood into two pieces.Is burning coal a chemical change? Why or why not?Burning coal is a chemical change called combustion.A combustion is the chemical reaction (redox reaction) of coal with oxygen O2.It is exothermic,which means it releases energy : hence the heat.Burning coal is in fact not one type of combusti.

## Dissolving Salt in Water: Chemical or Physical Change?
A physical change,on the other hand,results in a change of the material's appearance,but no new chemical products result.Why Dissolving Salt Is a Chemical Change When you dissolve salt in water,the sodium chloride dissociates in Na + ions and Cl ions,which may be written as a chemical equation :Colour&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Physical and chemical causes of colour According to the law of energy conservation,energy can be converted from one form to another,but it cannot be created or destroyed.Consequently,when a photon of light is absorbed by matter,usually by an atom,molecule,or ion or by a small grouping of such units,the photon disappears and its energy is gained by the matter.
