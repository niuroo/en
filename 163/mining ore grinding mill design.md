## Ore Grinding Mills
Ore Grinding Mills are used for the fine grinding as the last step in the reduction of an ore prior to concentration (gravity or flotation) or cyanidation.Practice varies,depending upon the type of ore and the amount of reduction required.In addition,some of the older properties continue with methods that perhaps are not considered the best in light of recent improvements but that cannot be.Grinding MillsGrinding in small plants,as in larger installations,has proven to be the most costly of all unit operations from both capital and operating standpoints.Therefore,grinding deserves the most scrutiny of all operations during the design procedure.A recent survey by a major grinding mill manufacturer reveals that more than 80 autogenous or semi autogenous mills having between 100 and 1,000.
