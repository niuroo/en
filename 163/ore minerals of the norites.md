Aguablanca is a Ni Cu (PCE) sulphide mineralization associated to mafic facies of the Santa Olalla hercynian intrusion.The sulphides occur as disseminated ore,massive ore and brecciated ore related to gabbros,norites and minor piroxenites and peridotites.Sulphide mineralogy includes pyrrhotite,pentlandite,chalcopyrite and pyrite.NoritePeter C.Lightfoot,in Nickel Sulfide Ores and Impact Melts,2017.Thickness of the metal depleted Norite stratigraphy.The observation that the norite stratigraphy of the Main Mass is depleted in Ni,Cu,and PGE lends credence to a model for the formation of the ore deposits by sulfide saturation and settling within the melt sheet as discussed in Chapter 3 (Fig.3.33 A F).
