## What is Fly Ash? Concrete Construction Magazine
Class C and F fly ashes were used in this research project.Currently,more than 50% of the concrete placed in the U.S.contains fly ash.Dosage rates vary depending on the type of fly ash and its reactivity level.Typically,Class F fly ash is used at dosages of 15% to 25% by mass of cementitious material and Class C fly ash at 15% to 40%.Use of Recycled Aggregates in Construction27&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;limitations of their use in concrete and or road construction materials.2 MANUFACTURED AGGREGATES These are purpose made from selected materials such as crushed rocks for manufactured sand,fly ash for fly ash aggregate,and by products from other mineral extraction processes such as clay for expanded clay aggregate.

effects of Silica Fume and Fly Ash on the properties of concrete.Water binder ratio was kept 0.42 for all cases and the specimens were tested at ages of 7,14 and 28 days.10% Silica Fume and 20% Fly Ash showed the lowest water penetration depth of 11mm and 15 mm respectively.7.5% Silica Fume and 10% Fly Ash were found to be optimum for maximumFly Ash in Concrete Pavement Concrete Construction …For 30% or less,abrasion resistance was comparable to that of the control mix; for 40% or more fly ash,abrasion resistance was lower.Jennifer Johnson,of ISG Resources,notes that some state governments have established guidelines for fly ash use in pavements to address alkali silica reaction (ASR) and sulfate problems.
