## Calcium Carbonate
Precipitation of calcium carbonate is a major operational problem during seawater desalination and it can represent a significant hindrance in solar heating systems.Due to relatively high concentrations of Ca ions and dissolved CO 2 in subsurface waters,calcium carbonate is also an important scale forming mineral during gas and oil production.Statement ZHDPE is also used for cable in conduit conductors.For the production of HDPE conduit,polyethylene resins and color concentrates are blendedin specific formulations and extruded into conduit and “innerduct”.The material Calcium Carbonate (CaCO 3) is often
