## Treatment of carbonaceous refractory gold ores
Autoclave leaching of refractory gold ores on an industrial scale started in the 1980's because of the high gold price and because pressure oxidation is an environmentally accepted alternative to roasting.Since 1985 about five autoclave leaching plants have been commissioned for treating refractory gold ores.0 CHARACTERISATION OF GOLD26&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;to the British Government programme of aid to developing countries.Zimbabwe is a major gold producer and the work described here was carried out to test the viability of gold characterisation studies in an area of ‘Granite Greenstone’ type gold deposits,where the geology and mineralisation are more complex than the other areas studied

## Gold mineral processing
In recent years,the industry has adjusted its mining methods from those needed for high grade underground deposits to those for low grade,open pit,polymetallic deposits.Meanwhile,large free milling gold operations are seeing their deposits become more refractory.Mine sits on 4,8 million ounces of goldThis marks a new phase as Zimbabwe starts producing gold from refractory ores.“Government will work on ways to enhance production from refractory ores and this includes an initiative by MMCZ (Minerals Marketing Corporation of Zimbabwe) to reopen the Roasting Plant in Kwekwe,” he said.
