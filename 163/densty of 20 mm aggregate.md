## AGGREGATE
2&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;the aggregate particles are to be considered as ﬂ aky,i.e.their thickness is less than 0.6 of their nominal size.The aggregate to be classiﬁ ed is separated into seven sieve fractions from 6,3 to 63 mm.Slot sizes are 4.9 x 30 mm,7.2 x 40 mm,10.2 x 50 mm,14.4 x 60 mm,19.7 x 80 mm,26.3 x 90 mm and 33.9 x 100 mm.DESCRIPTIONBulk DensityBulk Density Measurement Key points.Bulk density is the weight of soil in a given volume.Soils with a bulk density higher than 1.6 g cm3 tend to restrict root growth.Bulk density increases with compaction and tends to increase with depth.Sandy soils are more prone to high bulk density.
