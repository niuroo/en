## What is Potash?
Large potash bearing rock deposits occur in many regions of the world deriving from the minerals in ancient seas which dried up millions of years ago.Most potash for fertiliser is derived from one of these potash rocks,sylvinite,requiring only separation from the salt and other minerals and physical grading into a form suitable for fertiliser manufacture or farm spreading.Company Kore PotashKola has the potential to be one of the lowest opex potash mines in the world due to highgrade ore,shallow depth to the potash potash seam.The company will
