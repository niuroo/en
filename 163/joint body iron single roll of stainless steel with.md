## Stainless steel
The invention of stainless steel followed a series of scientific developments,starting in 1798 when chromium was first shown to the French Academy by Louis Vauquelin.In the early 1800s,James Stodart,Michael Faraday,and Robert Mallet observed the resistance of chromium iron alloys (&quot;chromium steels&quot;) to oxidizing agents.Difference Between Stainless steel and Mild steelDifference between Stainless Steel and‚Ä¶ Steel is one of the most common materials in the world,representing an industry that produces 1.3 billion tons a year,and it is a material used throughout the construction of many architectural fabrications.
