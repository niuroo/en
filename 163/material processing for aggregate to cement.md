## What is Aggregate Used for?
Aggregate is material used for the building and construction industries and is mixed with substances such as lime,gypsum,bitumen,cement,and other adhesive forms to produce finished materials such as mortar and concrete.Aggregate offers wear and erosion resistance,stability,volume,and other physical properties that are desired.Some of the aggregate processing plants that we’ve worked.AggregatesAggregates are inert granular materials such as sand,gravel,or crushed stone that,along with water and portland cement,are an essential ingredient in concrete.For a good concrete mix,aggregates need to be clean,hard,strong particles free of absorbed chemicals or coatings of clay and other fine materials that could cause the deterioration of concrete.
