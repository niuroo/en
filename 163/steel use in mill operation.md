## Mill (grinding)
Autogenous or autogenic mills are so called due to the self grinding of the ore: a rotating drum throws larger rocks of ore in a cascading motion which causes impact breakage of larger rocks and compressive grinding of finer particles.It is similar in operation to a SAG mill as described below but does notBall millA ball mill,a type of grinder,is a cylindrical device used in grinding (or mixing) materials like ores,chemicals,ceramic raw materials and paints.Ball mills rotate around a horizontal axis,partially filled with the material to be ground plus the grinding medium.Different materials are used as media,including ceramic balls,flint pebbles and stainless steel balls.
