## Calcite Mineral Uses and Properties
Calcite as Limestone and Marble.Limestone is a sedimentary rock that is composed primarily of calcite.It forms from both the chemical precipitation of calcium carbonate and the transformation of shell,coral,fecal and algal debris into calcite during diagenesis.CALCITE (Calcium Carbonate)A significant amount of calcite precipitation in sea water is undoubtedly inorganic,but the exact amount that this contributes is not well known.Calcite and other carbonate minerals are very important minerals in the ocean ecosystems of the world.Calcite is not the only calcium carbonate mineral.

## Calcite
5&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Calcite seas existed in Earth history when the primary inorganic precipitate of calcium carbonate in marine waters was low magnesium calcite (lmc),as opposed to the aragonite and high magnesium calcite (hmc) precipitated today.Calcite seas alternated with aragonite seas over the Phanerozoic,being most prominent in the Ordovician and Jurassic.University of Minnesota’s Mineral Pages: CalciteOn a more domestic front,calcite is the mineral that dissolves to form the ‘hard’ water (water with high concentrations of dissolved ions) present in many Upper Midwest communities.In homes without water softeners,calcite can precipitate from calcium rich groundwater to plug household plumbing or form a crust below dripping faucets.
