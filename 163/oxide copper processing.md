## Copper extraction
Copper extraction refers to the methods used to obtain copper from its ores.The conversion of copper consists of a series of physical and electrochemical processes.Methods have evolved and vary with country depending on the ore source,local environmental regulations,and other factors.As in all mining operations,the ore must usually be.Mining and Extraction: Oxide OresCopper is refined from ores in the ground,either through underground or open pit mines.Most of the copper ores mined today are oxide or sulfide ores.Extraction of sulfide ores is covered in more detail in Copper Mining and Extraction: Sulfide Ores (11 14),but is introduced here because an important by product of this process is used for the extraction of oxide ores.
