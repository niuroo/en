## Production Process
Portland Cement is made primarily from a combination of a calcareous material,such as limestone or chalk,and of silica and alumina found as clay or shale.The manufacturing process consists essentially of grinding the raw materials into a very fine powder,mixing them intimately in a predetermined proportion,and burning them in a large rotary kiln at a temperature of about 1400 ˚C (2550 ˚F).Analysis of material flow and consumption in cement.In the surveyed cement plant,three balances are established between input and output material in the raw mill,clinker production,and cement grinding system.2.48 t,4.69 t,and 3.41 t of materials are required to produce a ton of the product in raw material preparation,clinker production,and cement grinding stages; waste gases account for.
