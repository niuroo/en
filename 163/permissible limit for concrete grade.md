PERMISSIBLE STRESSES (CLAUSE B,IS456:2000) The working stress method is based upon the concept of permissible stresses.Permissible stresses are obtained by dividing the ultimate strength of concrete or yield strength of steel (0.2% proof stress) by appropriate factors of safety.ACCEPTANCE OF CONCRETE COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH15&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;concrete compressive strength in the ultimate limit state and.cc = 0.85 is the decrease factor taking into consideration the long term load bearing capacity.Accordingly for example the design compressive strength of a concrete (f cd) defined on standard cylinders which …
