## JKTech Laboratory Services
JKTech Laboratory Services Bond Ball Mill Index Test (BRMWI) A Bond Ball Mill Index Test (BBMWI) is a standard test for determining the Ball Mill Work Index of a sample of ore.The BBMWI is a measure of the resistance of the material to crushing and grinding.It can be used to determineBall MillBall mills tumble iron or steel balls with the ore.The balls are initially 5 10 cm diameter but gradually wear away as grinding of the ore proceeds.The feed to ball mills (dry basis) is typically 75 vol. % ore and 25% steel.The ball mill is operated in closed circuit with a particle size measurement device and size control cyclones.
