## Mineralogical effects on the dense medium separation of …
Dense medium separation (DMS) is a method often used to upgrade base metal sulfide (BMS) ores before their main processing stage,with varying results achieved for different ore types.The process makes use of the density differences between the BMS minerals and the lower density silicate carbonate gangue minerals,using a separating medium of density between the two ore components.RoastingIn oxidation roasting,the sulfide ore is first decomposed into low valence sulfide and sulfur,and then the oxide is formed.The oxidation roasting of some sulfide ores is exothermic.Oxidation roasting equipment includes a rotary kiln,a multichamber baking 3.1.6
