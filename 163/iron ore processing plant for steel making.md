## Steelmaking
Steelmaking is the process of producing steel from iron ore and or scrap.In steelmaking,impurities such as nitrogen,silicon,phosphorus,sulfur and excess carbon (most important impurity) are removed from the sourced iron,and alloying elements such as manganese,nickel,chromium,carbon and vanadium are added to produce different grades of steel.what is a wet processing plant iron oreBinQ Mining Equipment what is a wet processing plant iron ore,iron ore wet processing and crushing plant,Draw The Flow Sheet Iron Ore Wet Processing Plant S… Slideshare uses cookies to improve functionality and performance,and to provide you with relevant advertising.

## Beneficiation of Iron Ore
Ore,which contains an economical use of iron,is called an iron ore.There are many types of iron ore,magnetite (Fe3O4),hematite (Fe2O3) and (FeCO3),etc,which are mainly used for iron making.Iron ore is an important raw material for iron and steel production enterprises.BAOSTEEL GROUP Iron &amp; SteelBayi Steel possesses the complete production process from mining,ore dressing,sintering,coking,iron making,steel making to steel rolling.Bayi Steel has Yamansu iron ore mine and Mengku iron ore mine in Hami region and Aletai region,self owned iron ore mines with remarkable deposits in south and north Xinjiang,and a coal mine mainly producing coking coal in Aiweiergou,Urumchi.

## Iron ore pelletizing systems
Iron ore can be upgraded to a higher iron ore content through beneficiation.This process generates iron ore filter cake which needs to be pelletized to be used in the steel making process.Also during the processing of high grade iron ores which don’t need beneficiated,fines which are generated can be pelletized and used instead of being disposed of.IRON ORE AND STEEL PRODUCTION&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Iron ore and steel production.The minute video explains the mining and processing of iron ore,followed by its conversion to steel.The links below will take you to information and worksheets.
