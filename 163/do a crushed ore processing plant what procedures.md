## Ore Processing
30&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Description.Mekanism adds various tiers of ore processing for better ingot yields from raw ores.Each tier use a specific machine to process the raw ore ( for direct ingots,dusts,clumps,shards or crystals ).Then the product is processed by the machines of the previous tiers.Processing Methods Diamcor Mining Inc.In a Rotary Pan plant,crushed ore,when mining kimberlite,or alluvial gravel and soil is mixed with water to create a liquid slurry called “puddle” which has a density in the 1.3 to 1.5 g cm3 range.The mix is stirred in the pan by angled rotating “teeth”.
