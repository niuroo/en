## Tube Roll Design
Tube roll design is an organized process culminating in the production of a roll formed welded metal tube.First consideration is the products’ specific characteristics of size,shape and physical properties.The next consideration is the forming and welding machinery available to the producer.Tube Mill Roll Design: data MTube Mill Roll Design Center.COPRA&#174; RF Tubes is tailored to the needs of making round or rectangular tubes or pipes.Common types of forming and calibration passes are already stored in COPRA&#174; RF's data base and can easily be extended,copied or modified according to your own needs.The calculation of the roll forming steps is done according.
