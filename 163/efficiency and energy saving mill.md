## Three Energy Efficiency Measures for a Pulp &amp; Paper Mill.
Introduction Recently,this major pulp &amp; paper mill made compressed air optimization a mill wide priority.At the request of the utility company providing energy to the mill,Compression Energy Services performed a comprehensive energy analysis that outlined theWind turbine efficiency definition and comparing it to.Wind turbine efficiency is a useful parameter for comparing performance of wind turbines to other wind turbines.Comparisons of wind turbine efficiency to the efficiency of other forms of power generation is meaningless and misleading (which is worse than meaningless).
