carbon compounds that trap encapsulated gold and make leaching extraction difficult.These types of ores require pretreatment prior to cyanidation.Options for pretreatment include the following processes: • Roasting.• Bacterial Oxidation.• Pressure Oxidation (Autoclaving).• Ultrafine Grinding.In this paper we will look at&nbsp;.Effect of Pretreatment of Sulfide Refractory Concentrate. CiteSeerX1 Jul 2013.several authors have pointed out that less than 60% gold recovery by direct cyanide leaching,after fine grinding of mineral indicates a refractory mineral [1].The refrac tory ore must be destroyed or attacked by chemical means with the use of oxidative processes,such as oxida tion by roasting [2],pressure&nbsp;.
