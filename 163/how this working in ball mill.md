## Ball Mills
18&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;In all ore dressing and milling Operations,including flotation,cyanidation,gravity concentration,and amalgamation,the Working Principle is to crush and grind,often with rob mill &amp; ball mills,the ore in order to liberate the minerals.In the chemical and process industries,grinding is an important step in preparing raw materials for subsequent treatment.Planetary Ball MillPlanetary Ball Mill Working Principle.Planetary Ball Mills consist of several cylindrical grinding jars (positioned on the sun wheel as shown on the figure) which are filled with loose grinding balls.Two superimposed rotational movements move the grinding jars: Like in a planetary system the grinding jar rotates on a orbit around the centre.
