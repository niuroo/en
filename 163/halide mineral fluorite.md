Fluorite,also called fluorspar,common halide mineral,calcium fluoride (CaF2),which is the principal fluorine mineral.It is usually quite pure,but as much as 20 percent yttrium or cerium may replace calcium.Fluorite occurs most commonly as a glassy,many hued vein mineral and is often associated with lead and silver ores; it also occurs.Discover Evaporite Minerals and HalidesMineral collectors prize fluorite for its very wide range of colors,but it's best known for purple.It also often shows different fluorescent colors under ultraviolet light.Some fluorite specimens display thermoluminescence,emitting light as they are heated.No other mineral …

## Halide minerals
Two commercially important halide minerals are halite and fluorite; the former is a major source of sodium chloride,in parallel with sodium chloride extracted from sea water or brine wells.Fluorite is a major source of hydrogen fluoride,complementing the supply obtained as a byproduct of the production of fertilizer.Carnallite and.FLUORITE (Calcium Fluoride)Fluorite is a mineral with a veritable bouquet of brilliant colors.Fluorite is well known and prized for its glassy luster and rich variety of colors.The range of common colors for fluorite starting from the hallmark color purple,then blue,green,yellow,colorless,brown,pink,black and reddish orange is amazing and is only rivaled in color range by quartz.

## Fluorite
Fluorite is a halide mineral composed of calcium fluoride.This mineral has an isometric crystal system and a cubic morphology.The mineral derives its name from the Latin word fluere,which means ‘to flow’.Fluorite Gem5.comFluorite is a widely distributed mineral in the Halide classification,and is now mined in vast quantities.It is a suitable mineral for collectors and is rarely cut as a gem,but massive varieties are carved as ornamental objects.It appears in cubes,octahedrons,dodecahedrons,while other forms are rarer.

## Fluorite and Fluorspar: Mineral uses and properties
17&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Fluorite is very easy to identify if you consider cleavage,hardness,and specific gravity.It is the only common mineral that has four directions of perfect cleavage,often breaking into pieces with the shape of an octahedron.It is also the mineral used for a hardness of four in the Mohs Hardness.The HalidesFluorite CaF2 or calcium fluoride is another common halide mineral.The primary use of fluorite is in the making of steel and aluminum.It serves as a flux making the molten metal flow more easily.Fluorite is a popular specimen mineral for collectors.
