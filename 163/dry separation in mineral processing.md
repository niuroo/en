In mineral processing plants,the choice between wet or dry grinding is one of the critical issues,particularly in dry climate countries.In arid areas such as North Western Australia,the Andes and the Sahara Desert,and Africa,the shortage of water dictates the use of dry grinding methods.Mineral processingGravity separation is one of the oldest technique in mineral processing but has seen a decline in its use since the introduction of methods like flotation,classification,magnetic separation and leaching.Gravity separation dates back to at least 3000 BC when
