## philippines froth flotation process
Froth flotation is considered to be the most widely used method for ore beneficiation.In ore beneficiation,flotation is a process in which valuable minerals are separated from worthless material or other valuable minerals by inducing them to gather in and on the surface of a froth layer.Live Chat; Froth Flotation Method JXSC Machine20.1 Metal Deposits Physical GeologyDuring the ore forming process,some of the original minerals in these rocks are altered to potassium feldspar,biotite,epidote,and various clay minerals.The important ore minerals include chalcopyrite (CuFeS 2),bornite (Cu 5 FeS 4),and pyrite in copper porphyry deposits,or molybdenite (MoS 2) and pyrite in molybdenum porphyry deposits.
