## Gradation and Size
When the size of aggregate is greater than 4.75 mm ( say 5 mm) it is called coarse aggregate.Graded aggregates are used for better particle packing.The larger the size of aggregate lesser the cement required for same strength up to certain grade.Aggregate10&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Aggregate AfriSam Aggregate products are available in Gauteng,Mpumalanga,KwaZulu Natal and the Western Cape,allowing builders,developers,architects and engineers access to AfriSam expertise,technical backup and quality assurance,based on years of experience in the aggregate market.AfriSam produces ten million tons of aggregate from our

## A Detailed Guide on Grading of Aggregat
Grading of Aggregat Grading of aggregates is determining the average grain size of the aggregates before they are used in construction This is applied to both coarse and fine aggregatThe aggregate sample is sieved through a set of sieves and weights retained,Difference between “Maximum size” and “nominal maximum,The smallest sieve opening through which the entire amount of aggregate is permitted to pass is called the nominal maximum size For example,for the aggregate meeting the specification limits shown below would have a maximum size of 375 mm (1 1 2 in) and a nominal maximum size of 250 mm (1 in)

Nov 30,2019&#0183;&#32;Aggregates are the major constituent (ingredient) in concrete,making up 60% to 70% of the volume of concrete Aggregates influence the workability of plastic concrete and also the durability,strength,thermal properties,and density of hardened concrete Particle size divides aggregates into two categories: fine and coarse Most fine aggregates are sand and contain particles smaller than 3 8.HOW TO DECIDE MAXIMUM SIZE OF COARSE AGGREGATE TO BE,Mar 23,2015&#0183;&#32;The following conditions decide the maximum size of coarse aggregate to be used in concrete It should not be more than one fourth of the minimum thickness of the member provided that the concrete can be placed without difficulty so as to aurround all reinforcement thoroughly and fill the corner of the form
