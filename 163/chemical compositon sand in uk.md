## Composition and Properties of Bronze
Although,at one time,bronze was an alloy consisting of copper with tin and brass was an alloy of copper with zinc,modern usage has blurred the lines between brass and bronze.Now,copper alloys generally are called brass,with bronze sometimes considered a type of brass.To avoid confusion,museums and historical texts typically use the inclusive term &quot;copper alloy.&quot;CHEMICAL FEATURES OF WATER17&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Chemical composition of water can be represented by ionic diagrams (Fig.1).Thus the dominant ions can characterise the types of natural waters,eg.Na + and CI in sea water.Ca ++ and HCO in calcareous (calcium bicarbonate) water; SO = 4 and HCO in sulfato carbonate water and
