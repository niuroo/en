## Gyratory Crusher
With a gyratory crusher,at any cross section there are in effect two sets of jaws opening and shutting like jaw crushers.In fact,the gyratory crusher can be regarded as an infinitely large number of jaw crushers each of infinitely small width,and,as consequence,the same terms gape,set,and throw,have identical meaning in the case of the gyratory crusher.DESIGN OF MECHANICAL CRUSHING MACHINE2 U.G.Student,Dept of Mechanical Engineering,Sri Ramakrishna Engineering College,Tamil Nadu,India ***  Abstract The paper is about fabrication of mechanical crusher which would help to crush the used juice cans,paint cans and punched sheet metal waste.

## Crusher
The Blake crusher was patented by Eli Whitney Blake in 1858.The Blake type jaw crusher has a fixed feed area and a variable discharge area.Blake crushers are of two types single toggle and double toggle jaw crushers.In the single toggle jaw crushers,the swing jaw is suspended on the eccentric shaft which leads to a much moAnalysis of the Single Toggle Jaw Crusher Force.Therefore it is important to understand the force transmission characteristics of the jaw crusher mechanism and to be able to use them for sound mechanical design of the crusher.Today,the most commonly used types of jaw crusher are the single toggle and the double toggle designs.
