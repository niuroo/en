## Roasting (metallurgy)
Roasting is a process of heating of sulphide ore to a high temperature in presence of air.It is a step of the processing of certain ores.More specifically,roasting is a metallurgical process involving gas solid reactions at elevated temperatures with the goal of purifying the metal component(s).Often before roasting,the ore has already been partially purified,e.g.by froth flotation.China XKJgroup 30 years stone &amp; ore processing plant.Henan Xingyang Mining Machinery Manufactory,China xkjgroup a factory with over 30 years' history,is specializing in researching and developing mining machinery.With rich experience in ore dressing technology and work flow,we keep leading in ore dressing machinery manufacturing,inc

## Rod mills,how they function
Rod mills operate at lower speed than ball mills since the rods are rolled and not cascaded.For an equivalent grind,a rod mill uses less steel than a ball mill because of the lower speed and better contact between the media and ore.The rod charge must be maintained in good working condition,and brokgold mine machine ball mill,ore dressing ore french.ore grinding ball mill and rod mill; ball mills of khd humboldt wedge; ore dressing screening plants astec; gold ore grinder manufacturing in brazil; Projects.gold cil and cip plant design; granite grinding
