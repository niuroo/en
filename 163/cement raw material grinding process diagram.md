## Cement
19&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Cement Cement Extraction and processing: Raw materials employed in the manufacture of cement are extracted by quarrying in the case of hard rocks such as limestones,slates,and some shales,with the aid of blasting when necessary.Some deposits are mined by underground methods.Softer rocks such as chalk and clay can be dug directly by excavators.The excavated materials are …diagram on manufacturing dry cement processIn the cement manufacturing process,most material must be broken,such as limestone,iron ore,clay and coal etc.Limestone is the main raw material for cement production,each producing a ton of clinker needs about 1.3 tons of limestone,more than 80% of raw material is limestone.
