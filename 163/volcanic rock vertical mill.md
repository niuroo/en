## volcanic rock vesicular
Volcanic rocks often have a vesicular texture caused by voids left by volatiles escaping from the molten lava.Pumice is an example of explosive volcanic eruption.It is so vesicular that it floats in water.Volcanic rocks are named according to both their chemical composition and texture.Basalt is a very common volcanic rock with low silica.NC Greenways Geology: 2018&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Imagine a body of rock,beneath the ground,that has a network of parallel horizontal and vertical cracks,intersecting at right angles (like a Rubik's Cube).The cracks break the rock into many cubes or rectangular blocks.Groundwater seeps into the cracks and the rock begins slowly to chemically decompose.
