## Magnetite Wikipedia
Due to its high iron content,magnetite has long been a major iron ore It is reduced in blast furnaces to pig iron or sponge iron for conversion to steel Magnetic recording Audio recording using magnetic acetate tape was developed in the 1930sPipe CoatingsWith CWC,pipes are coated at the manufacturing facility with a special formula of magnetite infused concrete.The iron ore not only makes for a heavier,smoother concrete product.It also ensures even distribution and a smooth,less porous coating to help protect the pipe for many years to come.
