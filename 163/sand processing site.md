## Seismic Interpretation
In seismic interpretation,the reflection coefficient (RC) of two different rocks depends on the difference between their seismic impedance and this depends mostly on the P wave velocity in the rock.For example,the contact between sand with water saturation.How sand is made5 If the sand is extracted with a front loader,it is then dumped into a truck or train,or placed onto a conveyor belt for transportation to the nearby processing plant.If the sand is extracted from underwater with a dredge,the slurry of sand and water is pumped through a pipeline to the plant.
