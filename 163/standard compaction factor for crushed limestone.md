## Swell Factors for Various Soils
Swell is expressed as a percentage of natural volume,for example,if 10 yd 3 in the ground becomes 13 yd 3 after excavation,the swell factor is 30%.The following table lists swell factors for various engineering materials.57 Stone Compaction&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;No.57 stone should be placed in lifts and consolidated using conventional compaction techniques.It is very obvious when the stone is consolidated and locked into place,so visual inspection is adequate.It is field testable I understand but not using standard methods.I understand from geotech firm(s) it is a special process but can be.

&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Are compaction tests of #610 crushed stone reliable?? VanMeter123 (Structural) (OP).A plate compactor might work great for #57 stone but I seriously doubt it is ever going to get you to 98% of either standard or modified proctor with #610.You need some equipment with more energy like a Whacker Packer (jumping jack) or a RAMEX walk behind.Spike's Compaction Factor CalculatorIf you combine the two factors you get a factor (Spike's compaction factor) which will convert loose state volume to compacted volume of the material.You can use this factor to estimate the amount of material you need to bring in for a certain area that needs to be compacted.
