## Colloidal Silica What is Colloidal?
Colloidal silica is silica particles that are suspended in a liquid.The liquid is denser than water and has been stabilized electrostatically to allow the particles to stay suspended in the solution.The silica particles are also very small and do not have a large density.The range has to be approximately from thirty to a hundred nanometers.China Colloidal Silica,Silica sol,Levasil Colloidal.China Colloidal Silica,Silica sol,Levasil Colloidal Silica manufacturers and suppliers,over the years,we have established good relationship with our customers for wholesale Colloidal Silica,Silica sol,Levasil Colloidal Silica business.
