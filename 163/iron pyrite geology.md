## Pyrite Definition of Pyrite at Dictionary.com
Pyrite definition,a very common brass yellow mineral,iron disulfide,FeS2,with a metallic luster,burned to sulfur dioxide in the manufacture of sulfuric acid: chemically similar to marcasite,but crystallizing in the isometric system.See more.Pyrite (#73) Geology Department DisplaysIron is typically recovered from iron oxides,which occur in larger deposits than pyrite and are more easily mined and refined.There are more economical sources of sulfur nowadays than pyrite for example,as a byproduct of natural gas and petroleum refining.

## Early diagenetic pyrite morphology in a mudstone …
Euhedral pyrite also precipitated from iron dominated porewaters,but sulfide production rates from organic matter was such that FeS saturation was not reached at the sites of sulfide production.Instead,euhedral pyrite was precipitated directly from porewater when FeS 2 saturation was reached.Abiotic Pyrite Formation Produces a Large Fe Isotope …The iron isotope composition of sedimentary pyrite has been proposed as a potential proxy to trace microbial metabolism and the redox evolution of the oceans.We demonstrate that Fe isotope fractionation accompanies abiotic pyrite formation in the absence of Fe(II) redox change.Combined fractionation factors between Fe(II)aq,mackinawite,and pyrite permit the generation of pyrite with Fe.

## Sedimentary pyrite formation: An update
Under euxinic conditions a greater proportion of the less reactive iron minerals are converted to pyrite,as discussed above,but even here there is excess iron which does not react.In studies of thousands of sediments and ancient rock samples we and other workers have encountered very few instances where all iron in the sediment has been converted to pyrite.Wisconsin Geological &amp; Natural History Survey &#187; Pyrite— Pyrite was mined with marcasite,as iron ore at the Johns Mine S 1 2 SE Sec.26 T.6N.R.1W.near Montford (Heyl,et al.1959).— Pyrite is found at the Piquette #2 SW NE Sec.36 T3N R3W near Tennyson (Heyl,1964).

## Pyrite
The mineral pyrite ( ˈ p aɪ r aɪ t ),or iron pyrite,also known as fool's gold,is an iron sulfide with the chemical formula FeS 2 (iron(II) disulfide).Pyrite is considered the most common of the sulfide minerals.Pyrite's metallic luster and pale brass yellow hue give it a superficial resemblance to gold,hence the well known nickname of fool's gold.How do pyrite and pyrrhotite damage building …Pyrite and pyrrhotite are minerals known as iron sulfides.When iron sulfides are exposed to water and oxygen,a series of chemical reactions breaks down the iron sulfides and forms new minerals called sulfates.These sulfates take up more space than the original iron sulfides.As they grow,the new sulfate minerals push against the surrounding rock,causing it to swell and crack.
