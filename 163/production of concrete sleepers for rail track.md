## Types and Classification of Railway Sleepers
The added weight helps the rail to resist the forces produced due to thermal expansion and which can buckle the track.The weight of concrete sleepers is about 2.5 to 3 time the wooden sleepers.Pre tensioned concrete sleepers are usually preferred now daysServices providedSERVICES PROVIDED.Track systems planning; Ballastless track; Concrete sleepers;.The steel moulds for the production of prestressed concrete sleepers,and of other special sleepers,are extremely demanding production components.The special challenges encountered by the manufacturers of these welded components include great prestressing.

## Production of rails
Rail steel can be rolled at a temperature of about 1.250&#176;C.This temperature must be retained during the rolling process in order to achieve a homogenous structure.Profile,rolling mill (producer) and year of production can be read on the rail web as raised &quot;Rolling marks&quot; (Rolling marks),which have a long tradition.The standard length of.Railway Sleepers18&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Concrete sleepers.R.C.C and pre stressed concrete sleepers are now replacing all other types of sleepers except to some special circumstances such as crossing bridges etc here timber sleepers are used.They were first of all used in France round about in 1914 but are common since 1950.They may be a twin block sleepers joined by an angle iron.
