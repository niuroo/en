## How to Calculate Unit Weight Sciencing
Unit weight is one of a number of related basic physics terms that leads some students to confusion.Also called specific weight,unit weight is in a family of terms that,loosely speaking,define and relate size (volume),amount (mass),concentration (density) and force (weight),along with specific gravity.Density of Aggregate18&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;If the volume is unit then,Bulk Density= Mass.Unit in kg m 3 or lb ft 3.In this definition,the volume is that contain both the aggregates and the voids between aggregates particles.The approximate bulk density of aggregate that is commonly used in normal weight concrete is between 1750 kg m 3 …

volume of the container to yield the dry rodded unit weight in terms of weight per volume such as pounds per cubic foot.By knowing the dry rodded unit weight of a nominal maximum size coarse aggregate and the fineness modulus of the fine aggregate,the weight of the coarse aggregate needed per unit volume of concrete mix can be estimated.Aggregate Base Density Data&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The ( 180) density data comes from a &quot;Design and Control of Concrete Mixtures&quot; book and appears to refer to the &quot;particle&quot; density of aggregate.However,since the aggregate is made up of particles,it is reasonable that the compacted density of the aggregate is between ( 180 lb ft^3).

## Classification of Aggregates
30&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Classification of Aggregates.The variability in density can be used to produce concrete of widely different unit weights,see Table (1).The most common classification of aggregates on the basis of bulk specific gravity is lightweight,normal weight,and heavyweight aggregates.Density Of ConcreteA normal weight concrete weighs 2400 kg per cubic meter or 145 lbs per cubic foot (3915 lbs per cubic yard).The unit weight of concrete (density) varies depending on the amount and density of the aggregate,the amount of entrained air (and entrapped air),and the water and cement content.

7&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Basic aggregate weight volume relationships are important to understand aggregate structure and properties.Fundamentally,aggregate volume properties are desired,but since mass measurements are typically much easier,masses are typically taken then converted to volume by using specific gravities.The following is a brief discussion of the more important mass volume relationships of aggregates.
