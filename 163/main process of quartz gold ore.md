## Gold Ore
The leach residue is cyanided to extract liberated gold and the process repeated using still higher oxidative acid leach until all the nonrefractory.quartz veins were developed along a main fissure for about 900 m.In particular,some gold ore deposits contain the gold as particles embedded in grains of pyrite.In order to leach the.Common Gold Ore Beneficiation Process9&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The quartz vein type gold ore beneficiation process is mainly cyanidation method and flotation method.The cyanidation method is a method in which gold or silver in gold or silver ore is leached by using an aqueous solution of an alkali metal cyanide as a solvent,and then gold and silver are extracted from a solution containing gold or silver.

## Gold in Quartz
Quartz veins often fluctuate widely in value,with the richest gold ore occurring in pockets or “bonanzas” as they are sometimes called.In some mining districts the bulk of the gold is found in these rich pockets and the rest of the vein may be nearly barren.Process Mineralogy of Jinshan Gold Ore Based on …Traditional measurement and modern SEM based mineral liberation analysis (MLA) system were employed to obtain the process mineralogy characteristic of Jinshan gold ore which had high Au (6.20g t) and low sulfide (0.25%).XBSE,XBSE STD and SPL Lt MLA modes are used in this case,which make the results timely,reliable and quantitative.The gold behaves irregular granular native gold or silver.
