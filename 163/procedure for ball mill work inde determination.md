## Determination of Work Index of Gyel Bukuru Columbite Ore.
The procedure is as follows.1) 100 g each of samples of the ore under test and the reference ore were crushed and pulverized in the labor .Table 2 gives the sieve analysis result of the feed to ball mill of test ore (columbite) and Figure 1 is the graph.Determination of Work Index of Gyel Bukuru Columbite Ore in Plateau State,Nigeria.Procedure for determination of ball Bond work index …1.Introduction.A Bond Ball Mill Work Index test is a standard test for determining the ball mill work index of a sample of ore.It was developed by Fred Bond in 1952 and modified in 1961 (JKMRC CO.2006).This index is widely used in the mineral industry for comparing the resistance of different materials to ball milling,for estimating the energy required for grinding,and for ball mill.

## Ball mill
A ball mill,a type of grinder,is a cylindrical device used in grinding (or mixing) materials like ores,chemicals,ceramic raw materials and paints.Ball mills rotate around a horizontal axis,partially filled with the material to be ground plus the grinding medium.Different materials are used as media,including ceramic balls,flint pebbles and stainless steel balls.Bond Ball Mill Work Index Bond Ball Mill Work Index Fo.Bond Work Index Procedure and Method.This Grindability Test or Bond Ball Mill Work Index Procedure is used to determine the Bond Work Index of minus six mesh or finer feed ore samples.These equation application methods are used to process 1 2″ ore samples in a Ball Mill usin
