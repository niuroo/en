## US20030152508A1 Method of preparing zinc ammonia,
A method of producing a zinc ammonia carbonate complex solution includes heating a solution made from urea with added zinc from a zinc source in a first vessel to produce zinc and impurities dissolved in the solution and a residual; cementing the solution by adding zinc dust to form a slurry; filtering the slurry to remove a first precipitate and to produce a first filtrate; optionally heating.Aluminium sulfate WikipediaAluminium sulfate is a chemical compound with the formula Al 2 (SO 4) 3It is soluble in water and is mainly used as a coagulating agent (promoting particle collision by neutralizing charge) in the purification of drinking water and waste water treatment plants,and also in paper manufacturing
