## Characterization of the End of Smectite to Illite.
&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;A simulation decomposition approach for modelling XRD patterns is introduced to describe quickly and accurately the various clay minerals (essentially mixed layer illite smectite and illite) present in a sedimentary series,and to follow their individual evolution during diagenesis.The theory for these simulations is described briefly.Transformation of Clay Minerals by Calcium.Attached is a Technical Paper entitled &quot;Transformation of Clay Minerals by Calcium Hydroxide Attack&quot; which has been authored by Messrs.Sidney Diamond,Joe L.White and W L a Dolcho Messrso Diamond and Dolch are or were members of our staff and the research reported was performed as part of the investigation entitled &quot;Calcium Silicate Hydrates.

## Clay Minerals from the Perspective of Oil and Gas.
Even though there were the numerous sporadic reports about the application of clay minerals in the oil and gas exploration.So far,relatively little work has been documented on the detailed summary of clay minerals from the perspective of oil and gas exploration.CLAY MINERALS8&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;to occur in varying amounts in these fine grained or clay sized micas (1).Illite and glauconite (dioctahedral iron illites) are commonly associated with the clay sized micas; however,the structures of these minerals are poorly defined and likely to be representative of a mixture of weathered micas.Expandable 2:1 clay minerals exhibit a

Three mechanisms for clay mineral formation (inheritance,neoformation,and transformation) operating in three geological environments (weathering,sedimentary,and diagenetic hydrothermal) yield nine possibilities for the origin of clay minerals in nature.Several of these possibilities are discussed in terms of the rock cycle.The mineralogy of clays neoformed in the weathering environment.Formation and Transformation of Clay Minerals: the Role …27&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;in formation and transformation of clay minerals but intends to illustrate a few examples on the influence of bacteria on the genesis of clay minerals and pos sible “active” role of clay minerals on bacteria and organic matter.Excellent reviews in geomicrobiology have been published by the Mineralogical Society of America (edited
