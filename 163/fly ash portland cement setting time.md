## Using Fly Ash in Concrete
When portland cement reacts with water,it produces a hydrated calcium silicate (CSH) and lime.The hydrated silicate develops strength and the lime fills the voids.Properly selected fly ash reacts with the lime to form CSH the same cementing product as in portland cement.This reaction of fly ash with lime in concrete improves strength.Uses,Benefits,and Drawbacks of Fly Ash in ConstructionFly ash is a pozzolan,a substance containing aluminous and siliceous material that forms cement in the presence of water.When mixed with lime and water,fly ash forms a compound similar to Portland cement.This makes fly ash suitable as a prime material in blended cement,mosaic tiles,and hollow blocks,among other building materials.

Fly ash doesn't chemically retard setting.But many times fly ash is used in concrete as a cement replacement in combination with a water reducer.These concretes may set more slowly than a straight cement mix would.If fly ash is not being used as a cement replacement,but is added just to increase fines,it won't retard setting.An Ideal Alternative: Pumice Instead of Fly Ash for.21&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Concrete is such a vital part of civilization’s infrastructure,yet ordinary Portland cement (OPC) is not nearly good enough for the job.Unlike fly ash.The setting time of concrete mixtures was found using the procedures of ASTM C 403.In addition to the penetration resistance tests,ultrasonic tests were investigated to.
