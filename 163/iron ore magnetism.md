To start the quest,talk to Ava on the ground floor in the west wing of Draynor Manor.You'll have to search a bookshelf to open a secret door to get to her.You find out she is the new assistant of the professor at the top of the manor.After talking for a while,she says she will make you something if you get her some things to fix her bed.Not All Iron Is Magnetic (Magnetic Elements)Iron isn't the only element that displays magnetism.Nickel,cobalt,gadolinium,terbium,and dysprosium are also ferromagnetic.As with iron,the magnetic properties of these elements depends on their crystal structure and whether the metal is below its Curie point.α iron,cobalt,and nickel are ferromagnetic,while γ iron,manganese,and chromium are antiferromagnetic.

## Why Does a Magnet Attract Iron? Sciencing
Most people know that iron is attracted to magnets,while other metals like gold and silver are not.Yet few people can explain exactly why iron has this magical relationship with magnetism.To arrive at the answer,you need to get down to the atomic level and examine …Ferromagnetism17&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Ferromagnetism Iron,nickel,cobalt and some of the rare earths (gadolinium,dysprosium) exhibit a unique magnetic behavior which is called ferromagnetism because iron (ferrum in Latin) is the most common and most dramatic example.Samarium and neodymium in alloys with cobalt have been used to fabricate very strong rare earth magnets.

Reference.comAt temperatures below this point,iron atoms act as mini magnets,automatically organizing themselves in the same direction so their magnetic fields are stronger.Once heated past the Curie point,iron atoms are not able to align themselves as easily,and as a result,only a weaker type of magnetism,called paramagnetism,remains.
