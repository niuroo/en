## What is the manufacturing process of cement?
Hi,Following three distinct operations are involved in the manufacturing of normal setting or Portland ordinary cement: 1.Mixing of raw materials 2.Burning 3.Grinding MIXING OF RAW MATERIALS The raw materials such as limestone or chalk and sha.How Portland Cement is Made? Manufacturing …Portland cement can be made by following two different processes a dry one and a wet one.Joseph Aspdin first made portland cement in his kitchen stove in England in the 19th century.Lime and silica make up approximately 85% of portland cement.The materials that are commonly used are limestone,shells,chalk,shale,clay,slate,silica sand,and iron ore.Since limestone is the main.

## Cement Manufacturing Process
The dry process has been modernized and is widely used at present because of following reasons: Competition: At present,several dry process cement plants are vying with each other.The cement consumers in general and the practicing civil engineers in particular are …Wet Process for Manufacturing of CementThe kiln has to operate continuously in order to ensure a steady regime,and therefore uniformity of clinker.The larger existing kiln in a wet process plant produces 3600 tonnes of clinker per day.The manufacture of cement by wet process is energy intensive and thus uneconomical as compared to dry process and semi dry process.

## Dry Process for Manufacturing of Cement
The pellets are baked hard in a pre heating grate by means of hot gases from the kiln.The pellets then enter the kiln where temperature is about 1450&#176;C.The total consumption of coal in this method is only about 100 kg when compared to the requirement of about 220 kg for producing a ton of cement in the wet process.Explain dry and wet process of cement manufacturing.21&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The flowsheet diagram of the wet process for manufacturing Portland cement is given in Figure 3.3.The limestone is disintegrated in crushers.The crushed limestone is fed to tube mill,where the limestone and the clay,introduced as a slurry from a clay mixer,are simultaneously subjected to fine grinding.The dry process for manufacture.

## What Are the Differences Between the Wet and Dry …
The wet process of cement manufacturing involves adding water to finely crushed raw material,such as limestone,clay or iron ore,in a proportion of 35 to 50 percent water to 50 to 65 percent raw material to make a slurry that is fed into a cement kiln,whereas no water is added in the dry process.Manufacture of Portland cement19&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;hardening Portland cement,so it is more convenient to be use at cold weather.The early strength is higher than for rapid hardening Portland cement,but their strength is equal at 90 days.Because CaCl2 is a material that takes the moisture from the atmosphere,care should be taken to store this cement at dry
