## the use of coal conveyor belt
In 1892,Thomas Robins began a series of inventions which led to the development of a conveyor belt used for carrying coal,ores and other products.In 1901,TON invented and started the production of steel conveyor belts.In 1905 Richard Sutcliffe invented the first conveyor belts for use in coal mines …Petition14&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;In the course of developing this standard,MSHA reviewed accident data from the Province of Ontario Canada.The data detailed fires on diesel powered equipment in underground mines from 1984 to 1992.Of 289 fires during this period,one fire involved a fuel trailer,13 fires involved utility trucks,and 5 fires involved personnel carriers.
