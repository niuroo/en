Abstract.Being exclusively placer based,evidence of prehistoric tin mining in Europe was erased rapidly in the fluvial environment.Circumstantial evidence has suggested that the tin ores of the Erzgebirge along the German Czech border were exploited in the Bronze Age.Prospecting Placer Gold Deposits15&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Prospecting for placer gold,except perhaps in the case of buried placers,is the simplest form of prospecting.Gold,platinum,and tin are the principal metallic minerals won from placers,but gold (alloyed with varying percentages of silver) is the only metal that has been recovered in commercially important quantities from placers in the United States.
