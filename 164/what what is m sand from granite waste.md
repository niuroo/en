## How M Sand can save the ecosystem
M Sand (Manufacture Sand) and its Advantages.What is manufactured sand,or artificial,or engineered sand,as it is described? M sand is produced by passing boulders and stones through a series of jaw and cone crushers for size reduction and then fed into vertical shaft impact (VSI) crushers where they are pulverized further to the size of.Manufactured Sand (M Sand) for Concrete Properties …18&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;M Sand is obtained from specific hard rock (granite) using the state of the art International technology,thus the required property of sand is obtained.M Sand is cubical in shape and is manufactured using technology like High Carbon steel hit rock and then ROCK ON ROCK process which is synonymous to that of natural process undergoing in river.
