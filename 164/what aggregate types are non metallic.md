## The Density of Common Rocks and Minerals
As a general rule,non metallic minerals have low densities while metallic minerals have high densities.Most of the major rock forming minerals in the Earth's crust,like quartz,feldspar,and calcite,have very similar densities (around 2.6 to 3.0 g cm 3).Some of the heaviest metallic minerals,like iridium and platinum,can have densities.(PDF) Artificial Aggregate From non Metallic …Artificial Aggregate From non Metallic Automotive Shredder Residue.Artificial Aggregate From non Metallic Automotive Shredder.six types of aggregate.mixes were prepared,Ar90 20,Ar90 40.
