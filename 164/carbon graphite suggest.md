## Difference Between Diamond and Graphite
Jan 22,2011&nbsp&#0183&#32One of the important differences between diamond and graphite is the way their molecular arrangement is made.In diamonds,each carbon atom is strongly bonded to four adjacent carbon atoms.Probably this is the reason behind its hardness.In the case of graphite the individual atoms link up with one another to form sheets of carbon atoms.Raman Spectroscopy of Carbon — More Information Than YouThen came the fullerenes — buckyballs and carbon nanotubes — as Raman spectroscopy has become the tool of choice in characterizing these materials,especially the carbon nanotubes.More recently,Raman has been used to characterize graphene — single sheets from a graphite crystal.

## Why is graphite more stable than diamond? Quora
Jan 04,2017&nbsp&#0183&#32I would like to suggest an edit to the question first.It would be more appropriate If you ask why graphite is more thermodynamically stable than diamonds.Becauese diamonds are hardest and kinetically stable than graphite.Then why not thermodynaspecial graphite,specialties graphite,specialty graphite.19&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;A graphite crucible typically is made of graphite and clay that is shaped and fired to very high temperatures to form a solid container.It is used for melting non ferrous or non iron metals such as gold,silver,aluminum or brass.Graphite,a form of carbon,is often used for crucibles because of its high temperature resistance and low reactivity with molten metals.

These results are contrary to our expectations.We suggest that the thermal conductivity of Bi 0.3 Sb 1.7 Te 3.1 increased with increasing carbon addition because the thermal conductivity of carbon (graphite) is much higher than that of Bi 0.3 Sb 1.7 Te 3.1 (κ graphite = 100 W m −1 K −1 ).Orbicular Graphite in Oshirabetsu,Hokkaido,Japan 《Acta.Therefore,existence of highly crystallized graphite (such as flaky and needlelike graphite) may suggest that the graphite formed under the catalysis of Fe Ni Cu sulfide.The microstructure and nature of orbicular graphite will not only be of great significance for studying the formation mechanism and development of graphite but beneficial for production of new carbon materials.
