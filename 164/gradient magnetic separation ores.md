## Magnetic Separators For Mineral Process Bunting
17&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Magnetic separators can be found in most mineral processing operations,especially those processing non metallic minerals and magnetic ores.This article investigates the use of high intensity magnetic separators and magnetic separation equipment in the minerals sector with a focus on processing dry materials (in the mm,+45 micron size range).Recovery and separation of iron from iron ore using.28&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;shaft furnace can only process hematite ores with a granularity of 15 ~75 mm,and the shaft furnace roasting is also characterized by heterogeneity of the roasted product.Hence,the shaft furnace magnetization roasting technology is gradually replaced by high gradient magnetic separation with the development of high gradient magnetic separator.
