2&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Research on refractory gold ores has shown that existence of submicroscopic gold particles is the main cause for refractory ores.However,submicroscopic particles is not the only cause.Gold ores that contain high levels of Au Ag tellurides have poor solubility in cyanide.An electrochemical study of the copper gold cyanide …Gold and copper often occur together in ores,an occurrence which creates processing difficulties since cyanide leach solutions are not selective for gold.Copper contamination can result in serious problems throughout the conventional carbon inpulp process,often making the operation uneconomic.This thesis describes electrochemical studies of two ways of dealing with copper contamination.
