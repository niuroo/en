12&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Basalt commonly features a very fine grained or glassy matrix interspersed with visible mineral grains.The average density is 3.0 g cm 3.Basalt is defined by its mineral content and texture,and physical descriptions without mineralogical context may bedensity of 10 mm stone aggregate10 mm graded crushed basalt rock or aggregate,for use in concrete,called &quot;blue metal&quot; in Australia.20 mm graded aggregate.The rule of thumb is 1mm square=6Amp so 10mm square will,for safety reasons.What is the density of stone aggregate?.in 1963 version of the standard,the provisions regarding bulk density have not been.

## The Density of Common Rocks and Minerals
The densities of rocks and minerals are normally expressed as specific gravity,which is the density of the rock relative to the density of water.This isn't as complex as you may think because water's density is 1 gram per cubic centimeter or 1 g cm 3.Therefore,these numbers translate directly to g cm 3,or tonnes per cubic meter (t m 3).The Density of Common Rocks and Minerals&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;The densities of rocks and minerals are normally expressed as specific gravity,which is the density of the rock relative to the density of water.This isn't as complex as you may think because water's density is 1 gram per cubic centimeter or 1 g cm 3.Therefore.
