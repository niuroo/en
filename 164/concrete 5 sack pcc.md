## Density Of Concrete
A normal weight concrete weighs 2400 kg per cubic meter or 145 lbs per cubic foot (3915 lbs per cubic yard).The unit weight of concrete (density) varies depending on the amount and density of the aggregate,the amount of entrained air (and entrapped air),and the water and cement content.how we calculate of Sand,cement and aggregate of …M20 (1 cement :1.5 sand :3 stone brick aggregate).To determine the proportions you have to perform mix design,for this you have to find out the sp.gr.of cement,CA,FA,and water cement ratio.

Lean concrete and flowable concrete are terms used to describe low grade concrete slurry that is used in a variety of construction projects.In some ways the two terms are interchangeable,both describing concrete made with lesser ingredients,but there are some differences in how the two are used.Seven Must Use Concrete Admixtures (Additives)Accelerating concrete admixtures are used to increase the rate of concrete strength development or to reduce concrete setting time.Calcium chloride could be named as the most common accelerator component; however,it could promote corrosion activity of steel reinforcement.Nonetheless,concrete best practices,such as proper consolidation,adequate cover and proper concrete mix design could.
