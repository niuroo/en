## Exactly why is it bad to transport things with belts over long.
8&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;most people who play this game seems to agree that its a bad idea to transport things over long distances with belts.I wanna know why.Well the obvious answer I will probably get is that its alot slower than trains.But why is that a problem.Lets say I have a huge circuit factory that is producing a compressed belt which is traveling for 5 minutes until it reaches its destination.The.DRGM Images15&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Horsepower,Which is 33,000 foot pounds 0t work per minute.is the unitof measurement Of power.Chain Speed (In FPM) RPM (no.Of teeth) (pitch in.side traveling toward Small Sprocket Figure 17 Large Sprocket Stack Side Tight Side.Install the catenary take.up at the head end of the Conveyor: install all other take ups at the foot Or.
