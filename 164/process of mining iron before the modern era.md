In Ancient Egypt,somewhere between the Third Intermediate Period and 23rd Dynasty (ca.1100 750 BC),there are indications of iron working.Significantly though,no evidence for the smelting of iron from ore has been attested to Egypt in any (pre modern) period.There is a further possibility of iron smelting and working&nbsp;.History of mining: five of the oldest mines still in …Mining salt as a trading commodity did not commence until the Mughal era in the 16 th century,and it wasn’t until 1872 that the main tunnel was developed by British mining engineer Dr H Warth,on behalf of the British colonial powers.During the early years of British rule,the salt mine churned out around 28,000t to 30,000t per year of salt.

## From the Soil to the Iron Product the Technology of Medieval Iron.
It is important to emphasise that what we do is not only spectacular iron smelting experiments,but we revive the whole technological process from collecting bog iron ore to making iron products.Moreover,we can make pattern welded steel using iron bloom which is the peak of the contemporary technology.This is unique&nbsp;.Iron Ore Geoscience AustraliaHigh grade hematite ore is referred to as direct shipping ore (DSO) because,once mined,the ore goes through a relatively simple crushing and screening process before being exported for use in steel making.Australia&#39;s hematite DSO from the Hamersley province averages from 56% to 62% iron.Like hematite ores&nbsp;.

New methods of producing it by carburizing bars of iron in the cementation process were devised in the 17th century.During the Industrial Revolution,new methods of producing bar iron without charcoal were devised and these were later applied to produce steel,creating a new era of greatly increased use of iron and steel&nbsp;.The Hittites28&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Iron probably was not the mythical secret weapon which explained Hittite military success.However,they did develop a smelting process capable of producing iron tools,weapons,and ornamental objects.Their process was the result of years of metal working experience,not simply an accidental byproduct of an iron rock falling into a fire.
