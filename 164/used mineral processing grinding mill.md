## Autogenous grinding mills (AG mills)
Autogenous mills,or AG mills,can accomplish the same size reduction work as two or three stages of crushing and screening.Often used in grinding at modern mineral processing plants,AG mills reduce the material directly to the desired final size or prepare it for the following grinding stages.Energy Use of Fine Grinding in Mineral Processing,Dec 18,2013&#0183;&#32;Fine grinding,to P80 sizes as low as 7 μm,is becoming increasingly important as mines treat ores with smaller liberation siz This grinding is typically done using stirred mills such as the Isamill or Stirred Media Detritor While fine grinding consumes less energy than primary grinding,it can still account for a substantial part of a mill’s energy budget Overall,

## Sino Grinding Mineral Processing
Mineral processing typically involves the crushing and grinding of hard rock ore Crushed ore is introduced to semi autogenous grinding (SAG) mills,also known as primary mills,where grinding media is released like hammers to assist in the ore cracking grinding process The mix of media and ore rises and falls in the mill like clothes in a.Ball Mill Used in Minerals Processing Plant Prominer,This ball mill is typically designed to grind mineral ores and other materials with different hardness,and it is widely used in different fields,such as ore dressing,building material field,chemical industry,etc Due to the difference of its slurry discharging method,it is divided to two types: grid type ball mill and overflow type ball mill
