## Green Preparation of Expandable Graphite and Its.
26&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Although research on expandable graphite (EG) has achieved great progress,its practical application is restricted due to high sulfur content and serious pollution during production.Herein,low sulfur EG was prepared through a two step intercalation method using environmentally friendly hydrogen peroxide as an oxidant.By optimizing reaction parameters and process,the as prepared EG exhibits.Sandwich Structure Composite with Expandable …25&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Sandwich composites are increasingly used in high performance application due to their high specific stiffness,strength and thermal insulation.The sandwich composites were developed using honeycomb and carbon fibre reinforced composite face sheet in this study.Expandable graphite (EG) weighting 5 wt% and 10 wt% were filled in honeycomb or coated on face sheet to improve the fireproof.
