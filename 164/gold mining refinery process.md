A slurry of ground ore,water and a weak cyanide solution is fed into large steel leach tanks where the gold and silver are dissolved.Following this leaching process the slurry passes through six adsorption tanks containing carbon granules which adsorb the gold and silver.This process removes 93% of the gold and 70% of the silver.Mining and Refining ProcessBefore mining can commence the land needs to be cleared of timber and vegetation.Alongside this process may be the collection of seeds and or saplings,for inclusion in a seedbank,which will form the basis of post mining revegetation of the site.Next the top soil is removed and is usually also stored for replacement during rehabilitation.
