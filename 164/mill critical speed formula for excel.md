## Mill Critical Speed Calculation
7&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Effect of Mill Speed on the Energy Input In this experiment the overall motion of the assembly of 62 balls of two different sizes was studied.The mill was rotated at 50,62,75 and 90% of the critical speed.Six lifter bars of rectangular cross section were used at equal spacing.The overall motion of the balls at the end of five revolutions is shown in Figure 4.As can be seen from the.ENGINEERING.com Shaft Speed Calculator19&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;High Speed Machining has brought major benefits to manufacturers and will continue to do so.However,with so much talk about high spindle speeds it is tempting to retrofit for as high a shaft speed as possible,but there are more things to to be considered in selecting the right spindle.
