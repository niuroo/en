## From Idea to Production: Agglomerating Bulk Solids.
From the preparation of copper ore for heap leaching,to the de dusting of fly ash,and even the manufacture of premium soil amendment products,agglomeration is all around us.Reasons for Agglomerating As there are many benefits to agglomeration,there are also many reasons why someone may choose to agglomerate their material.what is agglomeration of oreagglomeration of ore to ensure that reactive liquids or gases are evenly distributed throughout the ore being processed.Agglomeration of ore into coarse,porous masses achieves this even distribution of fluids by preventing fine particles from migrating and clogging the spaces and channels between the larger ore particles.Binders are critically
