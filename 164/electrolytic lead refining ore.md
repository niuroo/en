## Lead processing Britannica
20&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Lead processing,preparation of the ore for use in various products.Lead (Pb) is one of the oldest metals known,being one of seven metals used in the ancient world (the others are gold,silver,copper,iron,tin,and mercury).Its low melting point of 327 &#176;C (621 &#176;F),coupled with its easyelectrolytic refining i DesignTag: electrolytic refining Silver.Silver is prepared in various ways depending upon the nature of its occurrence but especially in connection with the refining of lead and copper.It is highly valued for jewelry,tableware,and other ornamental use and is used in coinage,photography,dental and soldering alloys,electrical contacts,and.

## Electrolytic Refining Of Copper Process kapusangamin
The commercial production of electrolytic metals had its origin a century ago when James Elkington,an English electroplater,invented a process for refining copper electrolytically; later,about 1890,aluminum was first produced on a commercial scale by electrolysis,followed by lead in 1905,nickel in 1910,and zinc about 1915PROCESS FOR THE ELECTROLYTIC RECOVERY OF LEAD,Nov 13,1973&#0183;&#32;A method of extracting any or all of zinc,silver and lead from their mixed sulfide ores,and ore concentrat The method comprises electrolysing a slurry of the finely ground ore in the presence of a catalyst in the anode chamber or compartment of an electrolytic cell,said catalyst comprising an ion complex of a cuprous halide,
