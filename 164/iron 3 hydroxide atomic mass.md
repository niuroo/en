## Can you calculate the formula mass (Mr) of the,
Nov 08,2007&#0183;&#32;Best Answer: First you find the atomic mass for each element Fe(iron) is 56 so 2 by 56 =112 O (oxygen) is 16 so 3 by 16 = 48 Add them together (112 + 48)=160 The mass is therefor 160 Hope this is clearChemical Principles Atoms,Molecules,and Ions Wikibooks,Atomic and molecular weights are measured on a scale of atomic mass units (amu),where 1 amu is defined as exactly one twelfth of the mass of a I2 C atom A quantity of a chemical substance (atoms,molecules,or ions) equal to the atomic weight expressed in grams is defined as 1 mole of that substance
