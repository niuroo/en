## What is the mix ratio for grade C30 concrete?
IS 2000 has designated the concrete mixes into a number of grades as M10,M15,M20,M25,M30,M35 and M40.In this designation the letter M refers to the mix and the number to the specified 28 day cube strength of mix in N mm2.The mixes of gr.Calculate Quantities of Materials for Concrete …19&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Fa = Mass of fine aggregates.Ca = Mass of coarse aggregates.S c,S fa and S ca are the specific gravities of cement,fine aggregates and coarse aggregates respectively.The air content has been ignored in this calculation.This method of calculation for quantities of materials for concrete takes into account the mix proportions from design mix or nominal mixes for structural strength and.
