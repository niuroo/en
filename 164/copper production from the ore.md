## Escondida copper production declines on falling ore …
Production of copper in concentrates fell 8.8% to 689,210 mt while production of copper cathode fell 6.7% to 181,760 mt.Production at Escondida surged last year,reflecting commissioning of a third concentrator mill and a new desalination plant and the impact of a lengthy strike at the mine in 2017.Ways to Separate Metal From Ore SciencingWays to Separate Metal From Ore.Roasting is a technique by which carbon and sulfur react with metal to separate the ore.For example; copper acetate is reacted with chemicals to separate the copper,ore and residue.This mix is reduced,which involves placing it under extremely high temperatures,injecting a reagent (such as hydrogen or.
