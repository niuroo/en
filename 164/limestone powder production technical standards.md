## Limestone Powder SpringerLink
Fine limestone is commonly included in Portland cement by intergrinding,resulting in an optimal particle size distribution of the modified cement.In other applications,limestone powder is added separately from cement,for producing more stable and robust mixes,especially self compacting concrete.Production of different grades of Lime from …Lime is manufactured from lime stone.Lime is mainly used for manufacture of hydrated lime.Hydrated lime is a dry powder obtained by treating quick lime with water.It consists essentially of calcium hydroxide and some magnesium hydroxide.The project envisages production of lime by calcinations of limestone on vertical oil fired kiln.
