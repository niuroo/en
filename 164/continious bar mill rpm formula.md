## Understanding Rolling Process in Long Product Rolling Mill.
27 Nov 2015.Rolling The important parameters for rolling in the roughing,intermediate,and finishing group of stands in the rolling mill are temperature.Accuracy in calculating these parameters are critical when satisfying such geometric requirements as roundness (in case of bars and rods) and tolerance.Ball Mill Critical SpeedA Ball Mill Critical Speed (actually ball,rod,AG or SAG) is the speed at which the centrifugal forces equal gravitational forces at the mill shell’s inside surface and no balls will fall from its position onto the shell.The imagery below helps explain what goes on inside a mill as speed varies.Use our online formula The mill speed is typically defined as the percent of the Theoretical.
