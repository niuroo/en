## Slag Cement Questions
Slag cement (also called ground granulated blast furnace slag) is a hydraulic cement produced during the reduction of iron ore to iron in a blast furnace.Molten slag is tapped from a blast furnace,rapidly quenched with water (&quot;granulated&quot;),dried and ground to a fine powder.Contribution of Mineralogical Phases on Alkaline.In Japan,approximately 14 million tons of steelmaking slag is generated annually,and more than 60% of it is used for road and civil constructions.1) Because of the high basicity (mass% CaO mass% SiO 2),alkaline elution is the most serious environmental issue when steelmaking slag is used near coastal areas or rivers.Therefore,treatments.
