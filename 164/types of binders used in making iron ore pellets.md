## Iron Ore Pellet an overview ScienceDirect Topics
There are two main types of pelletizer that are used to produce iron ore pellets at industrial scale,the rotary drum and the disc Besides iron ore agglomeration,these pelletizers can also be used for other materials such as copper ore,gold ore,coal,and fertilizer [12 ]Pelletizing12&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The formation of raw iron ore pellets,also known as pelletizing,has the objective of producing pellets in an appropriate band of sizes and with mechanical properties high usefulness during the stresses of transference,transport,and use.Both mechanical force and thermal processes are used to produce the correct pellet properties.
