## Gold Gravity Concentration
19&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The object of gravity concentration is the separation of the heavy valuable mineral from the light worthless gangue.Complications are often introduced by the fact that various base minerals must be separated from one another,an ore being subdivided into several products.Most gold ores,however,only require separation into two parts—the “concentrates,” in which the precious metal is.Extraction and beneficiation methods of gold ores and.12&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Extraction and beneficiation methods of gold ores and minerals.In gold ore processing equipment,there are a lot of beneficiation and extraction method of gold ore mine production line.For example,between heavy tinea leaching,extraction of amalgamation and so on and their mixing process,wherein the flotation method is an important separation means.

## Gold Flotation Process
The main influencing factors of flotation include grinding fineness,slurry concentration,dosage,aeration,flotation time and so on.In general,these process conditions require beneficiation tests and practical experience to determine.The flotation of gold minerals generally adopts a grinding or flotation process.Common Gold Ore Beneficiation Process9&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The quartz vein type gold ore beneficiation process is mainly cyanidation method and flotation method.The cyanidation method is a method in which gold or silver in gold or silver ore is leached by using an aqueous solution of an alkali metal cyanide as a solvent,and then gold and silver are extracted from a solution containing gold or silver.
