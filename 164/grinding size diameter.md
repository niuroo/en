## Abrasive Grinding Paper
5&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Abrasive Grinding Paper The use of Premium SiC abrasive paper is the most efficient and practical technique for grinding metallic metallographic specime ns.Although many qualities of silicon carbide are readily available,only the premium grade SiC powder provides the most cons istent results and highest grinding rates.Largest selection of grinding media Glen Mills,Inc.6&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;It also follows that the finer the grind you need the smaller the grinding bead.Other size considerations include whether screens or gaps are being used to separate the media from the product as a rule of thumb the smallest grinding bead diameter should be three times the size of the opening in the screen or gap the progressive jackpot.

## Grinding of large diameter thin walled parts
4&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Grinding wheel selection When selecting a grinding wheel,the characteristics of the grinding wheel such as abrasive,particle size,hardness,binder,graphite packing and grinding wheel structure have an effect on the grinding quality.If not properly selected,it is difficult to achieve the desired surface roughness of the workpiece.Gear GrindinGPitch diameter or reference diameter (d): diameter of a pitch circle.Modulus or “size coefficient” (M): the module of a gear is equal to the pitch diameter divided by the number of teeth Z.Pressure angle (a): the angle at a pitch point between the line of action which is normal to the tooth surface,and the plane tangent to the pitch surface.
