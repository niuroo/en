Putting Ore in a Pulverizer typically gives you a 15% chance of a secondary,related,dust.(Note that there are exceptions,notably Gold and Redstone.Redstone gives you Cinnabar.) Putting that Ore in an Induction Smelter instead gives you a 5% chance of a Rich Slag,again with some exceptions.mercury ore technology24 Okay,so we are not truly dissolving the gold,we are actually forming an alloy between the gold and the mercury (called an amalgam).This process is not only cool to look at,but it also is really useful to extract gold from ore.The gold mercury amalgam can then be isolated and the mercury is boiled off or removed chemically.
