## What is Open Circuit Voltage?
Open circuit voltage (or potential) is voltage which is not connected to any load in a circuit.See the two examples below to see the difference between open circuit voltage with a voltage source which is in a closed circuit and connected to a load.As you can see,open circuit voltage is disconnected and does not form a complete circuit.This.What are the differences between open circuits and closed.Open circuit: The circuit is in an open state and there is no current in the circuit; That’s to say,it doesn’t work.Closed circuit: The circuit is in a closed state and there is current in the circuit.In other words,it works as normal.
