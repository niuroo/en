## Borax vs.Boron
Boron is concentrated on Earth by the water solubility of its more common naturally occurring compounds,the borate minerals.These are mined industrially as evaporites,such as borax and kernite.The largest known boron deposits are in Turkey,the largest producer of boron minerals.myb boron11&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Global consumption of elemental boron was estimated to be 15 metric tons per year (t yr).Boron compounds,chiefly borates,are commercially important; boron products are priced and sold based on B2O3 content,which varies by ore and compound,and on the

## Boron: Light and Lively
Fifth in the periodic table,boron is a “light” element whose origin has puzzled astronomers because it is not created in stars.It is “lively”,being an essential element for plants,and having medicinal properties,which has stimulated synthesis of organic compounds containing boron.Tourmaline B isotopes fingerprint marine evaporites …Values of δ 11 B from 14‰ to 26.5‰ for the Igarap&#233; Bahia and Salobo deposits confirm marine evaporite derived brines in the ore fluids,whereas lower δ 11 B values for the Igarap&#233; Bahia deposit (5.8‰ to 8.8‰) suggest that these fluids may have mixed with an isotopically different hydrothermal fluid,or one that had a mixed boron.
