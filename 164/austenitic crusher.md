## Weldability of austenitic manganese steel
This austenitic alloy work hardens rapidly under repeated impact and displays remarkable toughness.This property makes the steel very useful in applications where heavy impact and abrasion are involved,such as within a jaw crusher,impact hammer,rail road crossing (frog),etc.Manganese Steel Manganal Titus SteelManganese steel (Manganal) is an austenitic steel which means it is non magnetic.This property makes it useful in many applications such as bottom plates for lifting magnets separator drum shells for magn

## Manganese steel wear liners — Sandvik Mining and Rock.
Austenitic manganese steel steel alloyed with more than 10% manganese is work hardening.That means that high impacts like those in a crushing chamber for example cause the formation of a extremely hard surface layer that is two to three times harder than the rest of the alloy If impacteSteelSteel Steel Wear resistant steels: Another group is the wear resistant steels,made into wear plates for rock processing machinery,crushers,and power shovels.These are austenitic steels that contain about 1.2 percent carbon and 12 percent manganese.The latter element is a strong austenizer; that is,it keeps steel austenitic at room temperature.
