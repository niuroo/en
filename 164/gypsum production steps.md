Gypsum is a naturally occurring mineral mined from deposits formed by ancient seabeds as a raw material.Composed of calcium sulfate and water,it is used for a variety of manufacturing,industrial,and agricultural uses.An important property of gypsum is that it is naturally fire resistant.The Gypsum Board Manufacturing ProcessThe process to produce gypsum board generally consists of calcining and or grinding gypsum powder,forming a gypsum panel product and drying off excess water.Innogyps has prepared a training presentation that introduces the gypsum board manufacturing process in detail including: Gypsum and its properties; Gypsum chemistry
