## &#187; Dry washing for Gold
A motorized dry washing machine is excellent for the production demands of a one or two person operation.Under ideal conditions,it is able to process up to about a ton of raw material per hour,which is the equivalent of what a medium sized wet sluicing operation can produce.Looking for a magnet that can attract goldYes it can be attracted by a very very large rare earth magnet (so even can quartz not practical nor affordable). Gold has a specific atomic resonance frequency (I think it was something like 7Hz or less); it should play a role fine tuning the exciter inductor (John Hutchison is a friend of mine).

INTRODUCTION.Few atom gold clusters have attracted intensive research interest due to their atypical chemical and electronic properties and corresponding potential applications in catalysis (1 5) and optics (6,7).Particular attention has been focused on understanding size dependences,requiring controllable synthesis and characterization of well defined clusters with atomic precision (8,9).Hair,Balloons and Static Electricity sciphile.org15&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Static electricity is common on cold dry days.Kids at the playground go down the slide with their hair standing on end.Clothes come out of the dryer with that pesky &quot;static cling&quot;; socks have to be peeled off of the sheets.You walk across a vinyl floor in your wool socks and get an electric shock when you touch the doorknob.
