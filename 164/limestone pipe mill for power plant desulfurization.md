## Flue gas desulfurization ~ Power Plants
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Flue gas desulfurization (FGD) is a technology used to remove sulfur dioxide (SO 2) from the exhaust flue gases of fossil fuel power plants.Fossil fuel power plants burn coal or oil to produce steam for steam turbines,which in turn drive electricity generators.Sulfur dioxide is one of the elements forming acid rain.What's the use of vertical roller mill for power plant.The main fuel for the thermal power plant is coal,which,when burned,can produce sulfur dioxide,which damages the atmosphere.At present,the main ways to reduce sulfur dioxide
