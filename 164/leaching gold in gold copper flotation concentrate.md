## Arsenic leaching from a gold bearing enargite …
The high arsenic content of the flotation concentrate obtained from a gold bearing enargite ore for pyrometallurgical processing strongly diminishes its market value.An investigation has been carried out for selectively leaching arsenic from enargite luzonite minerals using alkaline Na 2 S solutions.The leaching and adsorption behaviour of gold ores8&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;gold was completely extracted by cyanide alone.The flotation feed and copper concentrate showed an enhancement in gold extraction due to the activated carbon adsorbing gold that would otherwise have been preg robbed.However,this mechanism did not explain the behaviour of the pyrite concentrate.For this ore the
