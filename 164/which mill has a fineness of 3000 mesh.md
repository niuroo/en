## Fineness
The fineness of cement is a major factor influencing its rate of hydration since the reactions involved occur at its interface with water.Ordinary Portland cement (Types I and II) has a surface area between 3000 and 3500 cm 2 g,while the surface area for rapid hardening Portland cement (Type III) ranges from 4000 to 4500 cm 2 g.Understanding Mesh Sizes19&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The designation mesh is simply saying the powder passed through a 325 mesh screen.If you needed a powder that was closer to size you would need to specify two mesh sizes.For example: Tantalum Powder,+100 Mesh,3N8 Purity This powder would have particles that were smaller than 40 mesh (420 micron) but larger than 100 Mesh (149 micron).
