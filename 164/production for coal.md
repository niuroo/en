## Coal Wikipedia
Coal is a combustible black or brownish black sedimentary rock usually occurring in rock strata in layers or veins called coal beds or coal seams The harder forms,such as anthracite coal,can be regarded as metamorphic rock because of later exposure to elevated temperature and pressureUS Coal Production to Fall 25% Annually in Volume Terms,Charcoal production and demand are excluded from the scope of this report,as charcoal is a product that can be made from wood,peat,coal,or other materials in a separate production process
