## How Do You Turn Iron Into Steel?
There are many processes that can be used to turn iron into steel but the two main methods used are oxygen furnaces and electric arc furnaces.Ingredients.Different ingredients are needed depending on the method used,however,these four are widely seen in most forms of steel production.CokeHow Iron and Steel WorkInstead,the iron heats up into a spongy mass containing iron and silicates from the ore.Heating and hammering this mass (called the bloom) forces impurities out and mixes the glassy silicates into the iron metal to create wrought iron.Wrought iron is hardy and easy to work,making it perfect for creating tools.

## Steel Production
The first blast furnaces appeared in the 14th century and produced one ton per day.Even though equipment is improved and higher production rates can be achieved,the processes inside the blast furnace remain the same.The blast furnace uses coke,iron ore and limestone to produce pig iron.Coal is a key part of the coke making process.How iron is madeIn this instance,we’re going to focus on steel production using a blast furnace,shown in the top left of the infographic,given its main ingredient is iron ore.

## The 6 Steps To Modern Steel Production Explained
Steel manufacturing methods have evolved dramatically since the processes of the industrial revolution began in the mid 19th century.However modern methods are still based on the Bessemer process which was practised over 150 years ago.This was a way to introduce oxygen into molten iron in order to reduce the amount of carbon contained […]23.3: Metallurgy of Iron and SteelSteel.Much of the iron produced is refined and converted into steel.Steel is made from iron by removing impurities and adding substances such as manganese,chromium,nickel,tungsten,molybdenum,and vanadium to produce alloys with properties that make the material suitable for specific uses.Most steels also contain small but definite.

What Is Steel making process? Steel making is the method of processing and producing steel from iron ore and scrap.It focuses on removing the slugs and other unwanted materials like phosphorus,sulphur,silicon,nitrogen,and excess carbon from the raw iron.Direct Reduced IronThe process consists of feeding preheated iron ore fines into a fluid bed reactor.A gas mixture (CH 4,CO,H 2,and small amounts of CO 2 and H 2 O) which is at 600&#176;C and 1.8atm is forced up through the iron ore fines bed reducing it to iron carbide.The reduction reaction of the process is:

## The Making of Iron &amp; Steel
5&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;2 Materials Used to make Steel 2.1 Iron Ore Composition Iron very rarely occurs in the earth's surface as a metal.It is widely distributed,combined with oxygen as iron oxides.In fact it is believed that iron makes up about 5% by weight of the earth's crust.Geologists recognise various types of iron ore,classified chiefly according to iron (Fe)How Is Cast Iron Made? SciencingCast iron begins its life as pig iron,which is remelted and often combined with large amounts of scrap iron and sometimes with steel.Contaminants are removed from the melted pig iron,and the iron,once melted,is then cast.Casting is the process of pouring the iron into a mold thus giving it a shape.
