## Iron Ore Iron Species and Gangue Mineralogy Mapping
Automated Hyperspectral Logging.The successful development of iron ore resources is fundamentally linked to our ability to accurately identify not only multiple species of iron oxide minerals,but also sub species,phases (eg.ochreous vs.hard) and associated gangue minerologies.FAQ: Coal,economic development and poverty reduction.Approximately 17% of global coal demand is for coking coal,which is used in steelmaking.In contrast to coal for power generation,there are few opportunities to completely substitute coking coal in the process of turning iron ore into steel using blast furnaces.However,according to new research,the quantity of coking coal can be reduced through the integration of other fuels natural.
