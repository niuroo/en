## Spirals
Spiral separators,or spirals for short,are a versatile method of gravity separation that can deal with a comparatively wide size range.Separation is achieved as a result of centrifugal forces induced by slurry running down the spiral,which forces lighter minerals to the outer bend whilst heavier minerals stay closer to the central axis.Gravity SeparationGravity separation encompasses a large range of processing technologies,from the comparatively simple sluices with no moving parts to highly complex centrifugal concentrators.All these technologies rely on the same basic premise that density differences between ore and gangue minerals enable separation.Using this range of equipment we can perform anything from scoping trials on.
