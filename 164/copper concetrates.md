## ABSTRACT
1&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;mineralogy of the copper concentrates are shown in Figure 1,with the corresponding elemental assays for each concentrate shown in Table 5.Dominant copper minerals in copper concentrate are typically chalcopyrite,chalcocite,covellite and bornite.In some cases cubanite,enargite and tennantite are also present.Copper: How it is Sold and Priced MarketCapCopper concentrates are produced by the beneficiation,or upgrading,of copper ore.A typical copper ore would be 0.7% to 2% copper,a typical copper concentrate would grade around 25% to 35% copper.Copper concentrates are either smelted and refined in house,or sold to custom smelters.

CRU’s Copper Concentrates Team operates out of offices across the globe,with representatives in Santiago,London,Singapore,Beijing and Sydney.We follow everything from anode slimes to sulphuric acid prices,to construct our view on the wider copper concentrates market.Below,we pick out 10 key themes that will steer the market in 2020.CopperCopper,as native copper,is one of the few metals to occur naturally as an un compounded mineral.Copper was known to some of the oldest civilizations on record,and has a history of use that is at least 10,000 years old.Some estimates of copper's discovery place this event around 9000 BC in the Middle East.[3] A copper pendant was found in what is now northern Iraq that dates to 8700 BC.[4]
