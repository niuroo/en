## How stainless steel is made
Stainless steel is an iron containing alloy—a substance made up of two or more chemical elements—used in a wide range of applications.It has excellent resistance to stain or rust due to its chromium content,usually from 12 to 20 percent of the alloy.Iron Ore Smelting ProcessThe ore is loaded into a blast furnace along with measured quantities of coke and limestone.Hot combustion air is supplied to the furnace and some form of fuel used to raise the temperature.The iron is reduced from the ore by carbon in the coke,the limestone aiding slag separation from the molten iron.The slag and molten iron are tapped off from the bottom of the furnace,the slag being.
