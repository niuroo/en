## The rise of mobile impact crushers for recycling.
The mobile impact crushing plant,also known as the tracked impact crusher or recycling impactor,is recognizable mainly due to the fact that these crushers are mounted on a tracked undercarriage.Overall range of capacity for mobile impact crushers is roughly about 100 to 500 tons per hour.Design and Development of a Plastic Bottle CrusherCrushers may be used to reduce the size,or change the form,of materials so they can be more easily and efficiently used in the purpose intended to.Crushing is the process of transferring a.The percentage of reduction in length was calculated.For all the input dimensions

## Secondary Impact Crushers
Alternatively,the grinding type of secondary impact crusher provides a very high reduction ratio for crushing medium abrasive materials such as river gravel and basalt of which the ratio of SiO2 is less than 50 percent.Grinding types of crushers have distributor plates that are useful for separating sticky materials.
