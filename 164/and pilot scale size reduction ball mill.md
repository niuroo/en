size reduction in a comminution device.Because grinding theories are imperfect and ore hardness can vary with size,grindability tests are designed to best represent the size reduction of the industrial equipment analysed.For that reason,it is preferable to design a primary ball mill from a rod mill work index rather than a ball millThe effect of feed particle size on breakage rate.data collected from operating plants and pilot scale ball mill.Erdem et al.[5] study is addressed to see the effects of ball size on grinding kinetics.This paper deals with the experimental studies on two different size feed samples and investigation of the influences of feed size on breakage rate in pilot scale ball mill.

The mill product can either be finished size ready for processing,or an intermediate size ready for final grinding in a rod mill,ball mill or pebble mill.AG SAG mills can accomplish the same size reduction work as two or three stages of crushing and screening,a rod mill,and some or all of the work of a ball mill.PARTICLE SIZE REDUCTION TECHNIQUES&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;BALL MILL Principle: The ball mill works on the impact between the rapidly moving ball and the powder material,both enclosed in a hollow cylinder.Thus,in the ball mill,impact or attrition or both are responsible for the size reduction.Fig: Ball mill 13 14.Working: The
