## How Is Iron Extracted From the Earth? Reference.com
Iron ores in the form of hematite (ferrous oxide) and magnetite are removed from the earth through mining.The use of heavy mining equipment is necessary to dig out large pits in an area with a large deposit of iron ore; however,because iron does not occur naturally,it is necessary to use a blast furnace to separate or refine iron from the other substances in the iron ore.Iron Ore Mines of Bell IslandBell Island ore was also shipped to more distant parts of the world,such as the United States and Germany.The iron mines drew Bell Island into the international network of the mining and steel industry,and over the period of mining operations ( 1966),distant powers and events shaped much of the history of the mines and of the island itself.
