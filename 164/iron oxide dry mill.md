## Rawmill
For this reason,the rawmill is usually placed close to the kiln preheater.Types of dry rawmill include ball mills,roller mills and hammer mills.Ball mills.These are similar to cement mills,but often with a larger gas flow.The gas temperature is controlled by cold air bleeds to ensure a dry product withoutPreparation of iron oxide nanoparticles by mechanical millingPreparation of iron oxide nanoparticles by mechanical milling.The aim of this study is to prepare iron oxide nanoparticles through dry milling using a planetary mill and to characterize the mill particles.In this work hematite nanoparticles were successfully obtained by milling hematite at a mill speed of 600 rpm,proving that dry high.
