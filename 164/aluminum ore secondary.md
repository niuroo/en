## Rebirth by Fire: Secondary Aluminum for the Win
With regard to energy,aluminum manufacture using secondary aluminum is hard to beat: A mere 5% of the initial amount of energy used is required to manufacture aluminum from recycling material.In contrast,producing primary aluminum using bauxite aluminum ore is extremely energy intensive.12.8 Secondary Aluminum Operations10&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;of aluminum requires only 5 percent of the energy required to refine a ton of primary aluminum from bauxite ore,making the secondary aluminum economically viable.12.8.2 Process Description Secondary aluminum production involves 2 general categories of operations,scrap pretreatment and smelting refining.

## What Is Aluminum Smelting? (with picture)
18&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The production of aluminum is generally divided into two categories,primary and secondary.Primary aluminum smelting involves a process that begins with extracting the metal from bauxite ore,a type of rock most commonly found in tropical and subtropical climates.AluminumAluminum readily combines with oxygen and silicon to produce clay and is found in great abundance in a red rock like ore called bauxite,which contains large quantities of the aluminum bearing minerals gibbsite,b&#176;hmite,and diaspore.Bauxite is the major ore from which aluminum is refined.
