## Metal Types and Recycling Process
The recycling of metals enables us to preserve natural resources while requiring less energy to process than the manufacture of new products using virgin raw materials.A considerable amount of energy is used in this step.This process is called Eddy Current Separation.Although aluminum is not magnetic,this technology can levitate it.the process of magnetic separationMagnetic separation is a process in which magnetically susceptible material is extracted from a mixture using a magnetic force.This separation technique can be useful in mining iron as it is attracted to a magnet.In mines where.(2005) the residues go through a magnetic separation step.

## what is concentration of an ore
Concentration of ores is important industrial processes and is the first steps to the extraction of the metals.Normally,the ore is concentrated by separating it from the clay body in which it occurs either by gravity,sedimentation,or by a floatation process,before …Dense Medium Separation Magnetite OreTypically 15% by weight of magnetite is removed through coal washing and re cleaning the magnetic concentrate from the first stage extraction process.This process results in the upgrading of magnetite to more than 66% Fe (greater than 95% magnetics).The upgraded product is then subjected to elutriation,to generate dense medium separation.

## Magnetic Separation
Carrier magnetic separation has been proposed for more effective separation of water and solids from acid mine water to generate very pure water (Feng et al.2000).As discussed in Chapter 10,dissolved heavy metals like zinc and copper can be recovered from acid mine drainage (AMD) by selective precipitation controlling the pH for the precipitation of specific metals.process of magnetite separation step by stepprocess of magnetite separation step by step.stages of the mining process hematite iron separation Iron process magnetite iron ore separation method YouTube 0183;32;The magnetite ore ismonly formed by the reduction of hematite and ferric hydroxide minerals in these rocks.
