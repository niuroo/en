## Calcium — Health Professional Fact Sheet
15&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Calcium supplements contain varying amounts of elemental calcium.For example,calcium carbonate is 40% calcium by weight,whereas calcium citrate is 21% calcium.Fortunately,elemental calcium is listed in the Supplement Facts panel,so consumers do not need to calculate the amount of calcium supplied by various forms of calcium supplements.HuberCrete Calcium Carbonate as a Partial Replacement …20&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Powdered limestone (HuberCrete&#174; calcium carbonate) has been previously examined as a potential partial replacement for cement.Finely ground limestone with a controlled particle size gives acceptable properties for replacement of up to 20% cement.In addition,it gives higher green strength,reduced permeability,and improved workability.

## Calcium Carbonate
Abstract: An entirely novel preparation method of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) from calcium hydrogen carbonate (Ca (HCO 3) 2) solution was presented and named as thermal decomposition.The variation of the polymorphs and morphologies of CaCO 3 particles with reaction temperature was investigated.XRD result indicates that high temperature favors the formation of calcite.Effect of Macro ,Micro7&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;in the hydration process of cement when calcium carbonate was incorporated,which was called the chemical effect of calcium carbonate,and similar results have been found in later studies [2,22,28 33].Subsequently,a large number of studies were conducted on the role of calcium carbonate in cement paste,mortar or concrete.
