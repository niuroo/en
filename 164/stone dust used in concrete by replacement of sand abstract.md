## Project on Partial Replacement of Cement with Marble …
In this project our main objective is to study the influence of partial replacement of cement with marble powder,and to compare it with the compressive and tensile strength of ordinary M20 concrete.We are also trying to find the percentage of marble powder replaced in concrete that makes the strength of the concrete maximum.Effect of quarry rock dust on the flexural strength of.Three replacement levels of 0%,25% and 100% quarry dust were used in the concrete mixes.The 25% is the optimum replacement percentage achieved by carrying out strength studies for 0%,25%,50%,75% and 100% sand replacement levels.
