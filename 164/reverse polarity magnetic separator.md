Discussion in 'The Hokey Ass Message Board' started by Drive Em,Apr 21,2008 Page 1 of 2 1 2 Next >,Ideally,you want the magnetic flux in the armature to peak right when the poles of the armature are in the midst of the strongest part of the permanent magnet's flux field So there is,What's the big deal about reversed polarity? StarTribuneJan 14,2012&#0183;&#32;The bottom line is that reversed polarity at outlets is a shock hazard Electronic equipment plugged in to an outlet with reversed polarity will still function,but that doesn't mean it's safe
