## Influence of Pressure Head and Sand Fineness on Filling.
11&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Influence of sand fineness and mould coat Sand fineness plays a very important role in the moulding process.The fine sand shows better mould filling ability.Coarse sand has more chilling power and solidifies the metal faster.This restricts the filling up of the cavity contours between the cylindrical sand cores and reduces the mouldWhat is the finess modulus of sand?Fineness modulus of sand is an index arrived based on the particle size analysis and then dividing the sum of the cumulative percentage of particles retained on the sieves by 100.it is important to note that higher the fineness modulus,higher is the coarser portion of the sand.
