14&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;soil aggregate represented in the measurements is indeterminate and will vary with the source detector geometry of the equipment used and with the characteristics of the material tested.In general,and with all other conditions constant,the more dense the material,the smaller the volume involved in the measurement.OUR QUALITY AFRISAM AGGREGATE PROMISE10&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Base and sub base materials are those materials that provide the supporting structure in any pavement design.The table below provides G1 to G7 classifications.Requirements for approved target grading: SANS M and Colto requirements state that the aggregate for bases and sub bases should be derived from hard,sound and durable rock.

30&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The bulk density measures the volume that the graded aggregate will occupy in concrete,including the solid aggregate particles and the voids between them.Since the weight of the aggregate is dependent on the moisture content of the aggregate,a constant moisture content is required.This is achieved by using OD aggregate.3 Aggregate Properties2&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;porosity and the bulk,apparent and effective specific gravities of the aggregate.As an example,specific gravity informa tion about a particul ar aggregate helps in determining the amount of asphalt needed in the hot mix asphalt.If an aggregate is highly absorptive,the aggregate continues to absorb asphalt,after

18&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Description.Construction aggregate,or simply &quot;aggregate&quot;,is a broad category of coarse particulate material used in construction,including sand,gravel,crushed stone,slag,recycled concrete and geosynthetic aggregates.Aggregates are a component of composite materials such as concrete and asphalt concrete; the aggregate serves as reinforcement to add strength to the overall composite.Bulk Density Of Aggregates Loose And Compact Bulk.Loose Bulk Density.Loose bulk density can be determined by filling the container with dried aggregates until it overflows from the container.Now level the top surface of container by rolling a rod on it.After that,weight the aggregate mass that is inside the container and divide it by the volume of container.
