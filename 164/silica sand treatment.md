## Silica,Silicosis,and Autoimmunity
11&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Silica and Inflammation.Silica (SiO 2) is an oxide of silicon and is most commonly found in nature as quartz.Silica exists in many crystalline forms (called polymorphs) with α quartz being the most common form ().Exposure to respirable crystalline silica (&lt;10 μm in size) occurs most often in occupational settings,where materials containing crystalline silica are reduced to dust or when.REMOVAL OF SILICAWater Treatment of Silica.Natural waters,generally,contain about 8 mg l of silica (Si0,).Another important source of silica in water is the sand watertreatments filter.When water treated by lime soda process is filtered through a sand water filter,a good amount of silica dissolves in it (forming calcium and magnesium silicates) due to alkaline nature of waters.
