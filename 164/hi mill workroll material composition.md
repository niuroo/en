## High Rolling Mills Metal Processing.
The biggest advantage of a high mill is that the work roll can be large or small in diameter and allow for substantial reduction because the area under the roll is substantially reduced.The work rolls can be large in diameter which allows large spindles and universals or flex couplings to transfer substantial torque into the work roll.Life of rolls in a cold rolling mill in a steel plant.The present study was taken up to examine the manufacturing and operational parameters responsible for the poor life of a cold mill work roll used in a five stand 4 Hi tandem mill in an Indian steel plant.It was observed that the imported rolls were giving an average life of 35,000 tons whereas indigenous rolls were failing after rolling less.

## Nickel Iron Alloy 4750 High Perm 49
Alloy 4750 High Perm 49&#174; is a 48% nickel iron alloy which combines a high saturation flux density (approx.16000 gauss 1.6 tesla) with high magnetic permeability and low core loss.This alloy has the high saturation flux density of any of tSteel Rolling :: Total Materia ArticleRoll changes on such mills are relatively frequent and time consuming.This type of mill is therefore used for primary rolling where rapid change of shape is required,even at the expense of surface quality.Four high mills are a special case of two high,and in an attempt to lower th

## Babbitt (alloy)
Babbitt metal is most commonly used as a thin surface layer in a complex,multi metal structure,but its original use was as a cast in place bulk bearing material.Babbitt metal is characterized by its resistance to galling.Babbitt metal is soft and easily damaged,which suggests that it might be unsuitable for a bearing surface.However,its structure is made up of small hard crystals.Material listThe appropriate material composition of this hard metal depends on the technical requirements of the application.Tungsten carbide is produced by sinter ing tungsten and carbon.The components are heated under high pressure and carbon is incorporated into the crystal structure of the tungsten.
