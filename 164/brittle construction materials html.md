## What are the uses of ductile and brittle material?
The use of ductile materials are many.Think of anything that needs to be bent,folded or formed without breaking.That is ductility.So it is car bodies,aeroplane bodies,household goods like stoves,kettles,etc.The list goes on.Brittle mater.Materials of Construction for FMI PumpsPump Head Codes &amp; Materials.Fluid Metering Inc.'s pump heads are made from various materials of construction for use in most applications.All FMI pumps are modular in design.The Pump Head Modules can be easily removed for cleaning or replaced with a spare pump head for use with different fluids.

## Concrete and reinforced concrete
Although reinforced concrete is generally a better construction material than the ordinary stuff,it's still brittle and liable to crack: in tension,reinforced concrete can fail in spite of its steel reinforcement,letting water in,which then causes the concrete to fail and the rebar to rust.Tantalum PlanseeTantalum's corrosion resistance makes it a valuable material in a large number of chemical applications.We use our &quot;unyielding&quot; material,for example,to produce heat exchangers for the equipment construction sector,charge carriers for furnace construction,implants for medical technology and capacitor components for the electronics industry.
