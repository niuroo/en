## Highest Compression Ratio for E85
&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Maximum compression ratio is more a function of the fuels octane rating which is inturn a function of how the molecules stucture and burning rate.Look at normal octane,its physical properties are nearly the same as isooctane,yet it has a 0 octane value and if used as a fuel,the compression ratio for an engine would have to be about 4:1.Copper Fit Energy Socks ReviewsEach and every day,millions of people suffer from swollen,uncomfortable legs or feet and poor circulation.Are you one of them?
