## Specific Gravity Of General Materials Table
The specific gravity of all other materials are compared to water as a fraction heavier or fraction lighter density,no matter how small or large the fraction is For example,ammonium nitrate has a specific gravity (sg) of 073 while dry ammonium sulphate has a sg of 113 (1130 kilograms cubic meter)Density of 3" crushed rock Earthwork grading engineering,Jul 01,2008&#0183;&#32;Density of 3" crushed rock,crushed rock is pretty well graded and there'd be plenty of finer grains to infill the voids of the larger aggregate Bear in mind coarser soils have a lower void ratio than finer soils So,just because you can see the voids of a large aggregate material,does not mean the void ratio is greater than a fine.
