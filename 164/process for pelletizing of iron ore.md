## Pelletizing Wikipedia
Pelletizing is a process that involves mixing very finely ground particles of iron ore fines of size less than 200 mesh with additives like bentonite and then shaping them into oval spherical lumps of 8 16 mm in diameter by a pelletizer and hardening the balls by firing with a fuel(PDF) Iron Ore Pelletizing Process: An OverviewBentonite is an effective,widely used binder in the iron ore pelletizing process.Its low price is.an important factor for its extensive use.However,bentonite incorporates silica and alumina.

## Iron ore pelletization
Although iron ore concentrates are generally higher in iron grade and contain lower impurities,the finer size distribution of concentrates limits their usage in iron ore sintering.Therefore,pelletizing is needed to produce fired pellets from concentrates as burden materials for …Iron Ore Agglomeration Technologies IntechOpenUntil the 1950s of the last century,the oxidized iron ores that were loaded into the blast furnace had granulometries within 10 and 120 mm.However,the depletion of high grade iron ore sources has made necessary the utilization of concentration processes with the purpose of enriching the iron ore.Because of these processes,a fine granulometry is produced,and thus iron agglomeration.
