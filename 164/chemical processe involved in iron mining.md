## Metallurgical Article about metallurgical by The Free.
Metallurgy as a branch of engineering is concerned with the production of metals and alloys,their adaptation to use,and their performance in service.As a science,metallurgy is concerned with the chemical reactions involved in the processes by which metals are produced and the chemical,physical,and mechanical behavior of metallic materials.Aluminium production processALUMINA PRODUCTION.Bauxite is crushed,dried and ground in special mills where it is mixed with a small amount of water.This process produces a thick paste that is collected in special containers and heated with steam to remove most of the silicon present in bauxites.

## Iron in the Industrial Revolution
The iron industry began to relocate to coal fields,which usually had iron ore nearby.Developments elsewhere also helped to boost iron by stimulating demand,such as the increase in steam engines (which needed iron),which in turn boosted iron innovations as one industry bred new ideas elsewhere.Cement Manufacturing Process Phases Flow Chart.Cement is the basic ingredient of construction and the most widely used construction material.It is a very critical ingredient,because only cement has the ability of enhancing viscosity of concrete which in returns provides the better locking of sand and gravels together in a concrete mix.
