## Safety of Nanotechnology Cancer Treatment
13&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Many nanoparticles occur naturally (for example,in volcanic ash and sea spray) and as by products of human activities since the Stone Age (nanoparticles are in smoke and soot from fire).There are so many ambient incidental nanoparticles,in fact,that one of the challenges of nanoparticle exposure studies is that background incidental.Calcium Hydroxide Nanoparticles for Conservation of.27&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;CaLoSiL nanoparticles actually remaining in the stone.This suggested two possible models for the distribution of particles within the stone: a thin dense layer or a wide sparse layer.Scratching and DRMS could detect no difference in resistance as discussed below therefore further tests were carried out to determine the treatment penetration.
