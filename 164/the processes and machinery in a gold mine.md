## The Mining Process Waihi Gold
A slurry of ground ore,water and a weak cyanide solution is fed into large steel leach tanks where the gold and silver are dissolved.Following this leaching process the slurry passes through six adsorption tanks containing carbon granules which adsorb the gold and silver.This process removes 93% of the gold and 70% of the silver.How To Mine GoldGold panning is one of the gold mining processes that has changed little.There are many fancy shaped gold pans that are claimed to improve the speed and gold recovery rates,but at the end of the day it is still about shoveling some (hopefully) gold rich raw material into a pan and washing out everything that is not gold.
