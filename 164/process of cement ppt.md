## Energy and Cost Analysis of Cement Production Using the.
9&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;In Nigeria,approximately 40 to 50 per cent of cement manufacturing cost is energy related; each tonne of ce ment requires 60 130 kg of fuel oil or its equivalent and about 105 kWh of electricity,depending on the cement variety and process type employed [10].Cement produc tion spreads across five geo political zones due to theI03 cement June 2010 GS gct31&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;cement plants would increase to 130 kWh t cement in 2030 and to 145 kWh t cement in 2050. PROCESS OVERVIEW Cement is a solid material made of clinker,gypsum and other additives.It is mainly used to form concrete,a conglomerate of cement,water,fine sand and coarse aggregates,widely used for civil engineering constructions.
