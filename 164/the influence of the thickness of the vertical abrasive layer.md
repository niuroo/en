## Influence of grinding pressure on removal behaviours …
The surface layer of rail material is under severe plastic strain,thermal cycling and microstructure transformation during the process of abrasive grain cutting,which results in high residual stress on the ground rail surface.Fig.12 shows the residual stress before and after grinding on the surface with the section radius of 80 mm.The rail.Frontiers Influence of Twin Carbide Structure on.3&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Influence of twin structure on material properties has been studied in the literature.Xu et al.(2012) studied the influence of wafer thickness on the fatigue performance of nano twin Cu.They concluded that both the fatigue life and fatigue endurance limit of samples increased with a decrease in the twin layer thickness under stress fatigue.
