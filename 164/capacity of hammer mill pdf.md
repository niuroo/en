whereas the hammer tip is travelling at a minimum of 16,000 feet per minute (4,880 m min) and perhaps in excess of 23,000 feet per minute (7,015 m min) (high kinetic energy).The transfer of energy that results from this collision fractures the grain into many pieces.Sizing is a function of hammer tip speed; hammer design andEstimation of maximum crushing capacity of hammer mills …&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;From the relation of Fig.7and Eq.(3),the mean residencetime in a hammer mill was expressed as follows: From Eqs (5) and (6),the maximum crushing capacity of hammer mill Fmax is expressed as follows Figure 8 shows the relation between the maximum
