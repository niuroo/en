## How to Find and Determine the Specific Gravity of a …
19&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;To determine the specific gravity of a mineral,you simply take a sample of ore of known size and put it into a volume of water.Weigh the water that was displaced by the mineral.This will give you the ratio between the mineral and the water.An example is if a mineral that weighs one hundred grams displaces twenty grams of water the specific gravity of the mineral is 5*0 or the mineral weighs.Specific Gravity: Mineral PropertiesSpecific Gravity,also known as SG,is a measurement that determines the density of minerals.Two minerals may be the same size,but their weight may be very different.The specific gravity of a mineral determines how heavy it is by its relative weight to water.
