## AC Motors Principle of Operation
Basic principles of Shaded Pole Motor.This shading coil (ring) arrangement displaces the axis of the shaded poles from the axis of the main poles;.Synchronous ac motors are constant speed electric motors and they operate in synchronism with line frequency.The speed of a synchronous motor is determined by the number of pairs of poles and.4.DC MOTORS6&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;4 DC Motors 4.3.3 Principle of operation Consider a coil in a magnetic field of flux density B (figure 4).When the two ends of the coil are connected across a DC voltage source,current I flows through it.A force is exerted on the coil as a result of the interaction of magnetic field and electric current.
