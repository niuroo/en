## Cutting and drying beveled siding
Do not buy a siding shingle attachment like Wood Mizer sells,unless you are planning to make shingles.It does a good job of that,but as a siding attachment,it is junk.You have to saw cants,take them off the mill,put the attachment on the mill,then reload the cants to do the sawing.shingle mills for saleI'm looking for a shingle mill View 25 photos of this 4 bed,3 bath,1,908 Sq.Ft.single family home at 28 Cambridge Dr,Glen Mills,PA 19342 on sale now for $399,500.390 Indian Mills Rd,Shamong,NJ is a single family home that contains 2,112 sq ft and was built in 1973.
