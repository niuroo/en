## Solid phase distribution and mobility of thallium in.
Thallium (Tl) and its compounds are non essential and highly toxic for living organisms,even at low concentrations.In this paper,we analyzed the presence and geochemical distribution of Tl in different mining metallurgical and sediment samples collected from several mining zones of Mexico.ThalliumThe addition of metals like thallium to glass can also reduce its melting point to as low as 150 degrees centigrade.As such low melting point glasses do not shatter like normal glasses,they are particularly useful for the manufacture of electronic parts.Thallium is also being tested in high temperature ceramic superconductors.
