## What are some examples of endothermic and exothermic,
An exothermic reaction can be as simple as burning wood It takes high heat or a flame to start to reaction,but once it starts burning,the reaction between oxygen and the chemicals in the wood bonding together creates heat which creates heat An.Differences Between Chemical Changes: Endothermic,The difference between endothermic and exothermic reactions lies in the words themselv "Thermic" refers to heat,just as in the word "thermometer" "Exo" means "outside" and "endo" means "inside" Thus,an endothermic reaction pulls heat into an object or area,while an exothermic reaction expels heat

## Exothermic reaction and Endothermic reaction
This reaction absorbs heat instead of giving it out and is called endothermic reaction 'Endo' means 'inside',so the word endothermic refers to reactions in which heat is absorbed In endothermic reactions the enthalpy of reactants is lower than those of productsEndothermic vs.ExothermicEndothermic,heat absorbed or in something,exothermic,heat being released or sent out.Endothermic must be supplied with heat and is basically the opposite of exothermic.An everyday reaction is in the cooking of an egg.There must be heat added or absorbed from …

## How to Calculate Endothermic and Exothermic Reactions,
By calculating the enthalpy change in a chemical reaction,you can determine whether the reaction is endothermic or exothermic Chemical reactions transform both matter and energy Though chemical equations usually list only the matter components of a reaction,you can also consider heat energy as a reactant or product When chemists are interested in heat [,]Endothermic And Exothermic Reactions Quick AnswerAn endergonic reaction takes in energy overall,while an exergonic reaction releases energy overall Because the energy changes in chemical reactions are almost always in the form of heat,the terms endothermic and exothermic reactions are used Endothermic and exothermic reactions In any chemical reaction,bonds are broken and then reformed
