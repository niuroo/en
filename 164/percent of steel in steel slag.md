More pig iron is added,the unwanted carbon combines with oxygen,the impurities are removed as slag and the iron turns to molten steel.Skilled workers sample the steel and continue the process until the iron has exactly the right carbon content to make a particular type of steel.A Short History of Steel The BalanceA Short History of Steel From the Iron Era to the Bessemer Process and Modern Steelmaking,The limestone drew phosphorus from the pig iron into the slag,allowing the unwanted element to be removed,Because EAFs can produce steel from 100 percent scrap—or cold ferrous—feed,less energy per unit of production is needed.
