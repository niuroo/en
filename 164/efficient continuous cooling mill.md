## CN2652559Y
The utility model relates to a smooth cooling and high efficient crystallizer for continuous casting of steel making,which can accurately reduces the cooling strength of a pipe wall at corner of a copper pipe of the crystallizer while increase cooling of edges to make the cooling strength of a corner of a copper pipe is equal to the edge,significantly improve the cooSugar drying and cooling plants BMACooling is as important for sugar storing and sugar quality as the drying process.The fluidized bed offers excellent conditions for perfect heat and mass transfer,with the special feature that granular and crystalline solids are moved in a current of air.
