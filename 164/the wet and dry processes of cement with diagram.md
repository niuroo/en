## How Portland Cement is Made? Manufacturing Process,
Portland cement can be made by following two different processes a dry one and a wet one The manufacturing process has moved on significantly since bricklayer Joseph Aspdin first made portland cement in his kitchen stove in England in the 19th centuryCement Manufacturing ProcessThe process is accordingly known as the dry process or the wet process of mixing.Dry process (modern technology) In this process,the raw materials are first reduced in size of about 25mm in crushers.A current of dry air is then passed over these dried materials.These materials are then pulverized into fine powder in ball mills and tube mills.
