## Raw Material Preparation Industrial Efficiency,
The production of one ton of portland cement requires more than 15 ton of raw materials Raw material preparation is an electricity intensive stage,typically requiring 25 to 35 kWh of electricity per ton of processed raw material,although the energy consumption can be as low as 11 kWh tUse of raw materials in the cement industry vdz onlinedeThe capital intensive cement industry needs to secure valuable deposits over the long term Close geographical links between cement production and mining sites is also extremely important Short routes for supply of raw materials take pressure off of traffic volumes and reduce transport related emission of pollutants
