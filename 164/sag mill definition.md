## Mining Industry: What is the difference of ball mill.
Most mills used in mining rely on impact to breakdown rock to a suitable size for downstream processing.The impact can be rock on rock such as in an Autogenous Grinding (AG) mill,rock and a small ball charge (~10%),used in Semi Autogenous Grind.Grinding millsEvery mining operation has a unique grinding process.Metso has experience of over 8,000 grinding mills globally,including manufacturing and delivering the largest SAG AG mills in the world.Our experts welcome the opportunity to assist you with circuit and circuit control design as well as start up,operation,and optimization of your mill.
