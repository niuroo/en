## Milling Process,Defects,Equipment
End milling An end mill makes either peripheral or slot cuts,determined by the step over distance,across the workpiece in order to machine a specified feature,such as a profile,slot,pocket,or even a complex surface contour.The depth of the feature may be machined in a single pass or may be reached by machining at a smaller axial depth of cut and making multiple passes.Ball Mill OperationThe grinding circuit operator must ensure that the ball mill runs properly loaded and gives the correct ore grind.A major practical indication of mill loading is the sound made by the mill.A properly loaded mill will have a deep rhythmic roar,while an under loaded mill will have a metallic rattling type noise and an overloaded mill will be quite silent.
