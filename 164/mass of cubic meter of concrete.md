A typical concrete mix weighs 150 lbs per cubic foot,4,050 lbs per cubic yard,or 2,400 kg per cubic meter.The weight of concrete is determined by its density,which can vary based on the amount of aggregate,water,and air in the mix.Density Of ConcreteThe density of lightweight concrete is 1920 kg per cubic meter or 116 lbs per cubic foot (3132 lbs per cubic yard).Lightweight concrete weighs less because it is made with an aggregate called pumice,a naturally light mineral.Density is simply a mass to volume ratio.
