## The working principle of ball mill
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;The ball mill consists of a metal cylinder and a ball.The working principle is that when the cylinder is rotated,the grinding body (ball) and the object to be polished (material) installed in the cylinder are rotated by the cylinder undBall MillsWorking Principle &amp; Operation.The apparent difference in capacities between grinding mills (listed as being the same size) is due to the fact that there is no uniform method of designating the size of a mill,for example: a 5′ x 5′ Ball Mill has a working diameter of 5′ inside the liners and has 20 per cent more capacity than all other ball mills designated as 5′ x 5′ where the.
