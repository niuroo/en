## Mixing as a driver of temporal variations in river.
Additionally,there is significant gold mining activity on the banks of the lower Madre de Dios River and especially within the Colorado subcatchment [Asner et al.2013],and these activities may have an effect on the dissolved concentrations of some trace elements.4.3.2 …Arsenic and fluoride in the groundwater of Mexico.In Mexico,groundwater supplies most drinking water.Even in the absence of mining activities,hydrogeochemistry and statistical techniques showed that arsenopyrite oxidation may also contaminate water,as in the case of the Independencia aquifer in the Mexican Altiplano.High concentrations of arsenic have also been detected in geothermal.
