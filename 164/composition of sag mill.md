The effects on mill performance of a varying ratio of these two components in the mill feed are not well described by the current generation of AG SAG models (Stange,1996).(PDF) Performance enhancement tools for grinding mills.the mill liners instead of being directed to impact on the SAG and ball mills have grown in size and there are now mill load (see Figure 2),resulting in wasting large amounts many operational mills in the range of 28 40 feet in of energy,damaging and breaking mill liners (Figure 3 and diameter with installed powers ranging between 8 20 MW.

SAG mill energy required according to this statement,is 2.5 times more than the Ab value to produce the same degree of particle breakage.There is a speci ﬁ c gravity factor that affects AG SAGGrinding &amp; Classification CircuitsGrinding &amp; Classification Circuits.(this should also reduce the circulating pebble load in the SAG circuit).If your ball mill is drawing less than the full installed power while operating,add grinding steel if the mass of additional steel drives the bearing pressure higher,it should be offset at least partially by reduced solids.

Also we observe for SAG mills that ore competence and feed size distribution,being major influence on rock to steel ratio in the mill,are significant factors that influence SAG mill steel wear.We've observed the abrasion index to be a less useful means of predicting SAG mill grinding media wear.Optimum choice of the make up ball sizes for maximum.A grinding circuit simulation combined with ball weal law was used to determine the optimum composition of the make up ball sizes in tumbling ball mills.It was found that the optimum composition depends on var
