## Importance of fine ore chemical composition and high.
5&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;However,little has been published on the implications of ore chemical composition for iron ore sinter and pellet product quality.The ore bulk composition and the nature of the minerals in the fine ore both play a critical role in determining the type of high temperature bonding phases that form during sintering and pelletising.Assessment of iron ore pellets production using two.In Brazil iron ore pelletizing is an important economic activity,with a large volume of production and relevant thermal consumption (remarkably coal,heavy oil and gas),development of alternative fuels,such as eucalyptus charcoal,can generate relevant environmental,economic,technological and …
