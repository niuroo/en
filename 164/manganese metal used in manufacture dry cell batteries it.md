## Batteries Boundless Chemistry
Unlike a wet cell,a dry cell can operate in any orientation without spilling,as it contains no free liquid.This versatility makes it suitable for portable equipment.By comparison,the first wet cell batteries were typically fragile glass containers with lead rods hanging from an open top.They,therefore,needed careful handling to avoid.BU : Battery Raw Materials Battery University15&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;(See BU : Health Concerns with Batteries.) Manganese: Manganese with symbol Mn is produced by mining iron and other minerals.The metal is a relatively abundant and is mined worldwide except in North America.Steel manufacturing uses roughly 90 percent of manganese production; the remaining 10% is used in specialty chemical and agricultural.
