## U.S.Energy Requirements for Aluminum Production
4&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;energy required to produce the fuels and electricity that are used plus the “feedstock energy” associated with any fuels that are used as materials (e.g.carbon used in anode production).This document,in many places,reports energy as a set of two numbers,e.g.1.0 (2.0Aluminum Recycling The Aluminum AssociationRecycling aluminum saves more than 90 percent of the energy that would be needed to create a comparable amount of the metal from raw materials.Tossing away an aluminum can wastes as much energy as pouring out half of that can’s volume of gasoline.Nearly 75 percent of all aluminum produced is still in use today.

## How aluminum foil is made
Aluminum foil is made from an aluminum alloy which contains between 92 and 99 percent aluminum.This is accomplished in a rolling mill,where the material is passed several times through metal rolls called work rolls.As the sheets (or webs) of aluminum pass through the rolls,they are squeezed thinner and extruded through the gap between.Rusal[citation needed] In 2006,RUSAL acquired assets of the state owned Aroaima Mining Company in Guyana,acquired the remaining equity interest in the Friguia bauxite and alumina complex in Guinea,completed an extensive retrofit of the Armenal foil mill and commissioned the Khakas aluminium smelter in Russia,one of the most adv

## Aluminum and Aluminum Castings Metal Casting Resources
The aluminum production process generates CO 2,resulting in a higher carbon footprint for aluminum products.Many manufacturers locate the aluminum smelters alongside renewable energy sources,such as hydropower plants,rather than generating the electricity from fossil fuels.In its soluble form,Al 3+,aluminum is toxic to plants.Charpy impact testThe Charpy impact test,also known as the Charpy V notch test,is a standardized high strain rate test which determines the amount of energy absorbed by a material during fracture.This absorbed energy is a measure of a given material's notch toughness and acts as a tool to study temperature dependent ductile brittle transition.It is widely applied in industry,since it is easy to prepare and.
