## Laboratory Ball Mills Bench and Floor Jar Mills
Ball Mills use grinding media in spherical or cylindrical shapes in rotating containers to grind a wide range of material types to very fine sizes.Jars and grinding media are available in a wide variety of material types to optimize performance characteristics for long term wearPOLYCOM high pressure grinding rollmills can have correspondingly smaller sizes than usual.The material is dried in the ball mill.This system allows for the incorporation of several ball mills and permits separate pri mary grinding of different components.The defined size of the feed material allows for optimum grading of the ball charge.
