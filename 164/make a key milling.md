## Keyway Milling Smithy
18&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;KEYWAY MILLING Keyways are grooves of different shapes cut along the axis of the cylindrical surface of shafts,into which keys are fitted to provide a positive method of locating and driving members on the shafts.A keyway is also machined in the mounted member to receive the key.A Closer Look at Vertical and Horizontal Milling …Horizontal machines also have a fourth axis “tombstone” capacity.“When you buy a horizontal milling machine,the spindle is pointing horizontally,and the table is horizontal; but it is designed for threaded mounting holes or key slots,where a fixture or base is mounted,called a ‘tombstone.’
