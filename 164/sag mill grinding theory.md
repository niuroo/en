## Basic Grinding Theory 221
&quot;Basic Grinding Theory&quot; provides an overview of the general process of grinding.Grinding occurs at the point of contact between an abrasive wheel and a workpiece.Like any other cutting process,grinding removes material in the form of chips.In order for a wheel to grind properly,its abrasive grains must wearThe working principle of ball mill · The ball mill consists of a metal cylinder and a ball.The working principle is that when the cylinder is rotated,the grinding body (ball) and the object to be polished (material) installed in the cylinder are rotated by the cylinder under the action of friction and centrifugal force.
