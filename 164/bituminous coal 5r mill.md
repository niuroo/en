The shift to bituminous coal and coke occurred more slowly.In the 1810s,Thomas Lewis was the first to make coke in America,for Isaac Meason's rolling mill constructed at Plumsock and then at Bear Creek Furnace.These early coke furnaces,however,failed due to a weak blast,inferior coal and coke,and inadequate transportation.What You Should Know About Metallurgical CoalCaking refers to the coal's ability to be converted into coke,a pure form of carbon that can be used in basic oxygen furnaces.Bituminous coal‚Äîgenerally classified as a metallurgical grade‚Äîis harder and blacker and contains more carbon and less moisture and ash than low rank coals.
