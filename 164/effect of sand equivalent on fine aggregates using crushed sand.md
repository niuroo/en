The main objective of this study is to contribute to the optimization of the formulation of sand concretes and its valorisation according to natural sands from different quarries or extraction sites.Physical characteristics of natural sands have been determined and improved by the addition of crushing sand,taking into account the too fine elements of the sand.Effects of Sand Quality on Compressive Strength of.5&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Failure of concrete structures leading to collapse of buildings has initiated various researches on the quality of construction materials.Collapse of buildings resulting to injuries,loss of lives and investments has been largely attributed to use of poor quality concrete ingredients.Information on the effect of silt and clay content and organic impurities present in building sand being.
