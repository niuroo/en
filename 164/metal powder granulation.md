## Limitations of metal powder injection MIM technology.
15&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Compared with powder metallurgy,metal powder injection molding technology of MIM material cost is higher,MIM technology requirement for raw material is higher,which means that the diameter of the metal powder should be smaller,in order to get.A Comparison of Granulation TechnologiesThus,the primary powder particles are aggregated under high pressure using swaying or high shear mixer granulators.Dry granulation can be done in two ways: either a large tablet (slug) is produced in a heavy duty tableting press or the powder is squeezed between two rollers to produce a sheet of materials (roller compactor chilsonator).
