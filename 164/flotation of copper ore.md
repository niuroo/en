## A Review of the Flotation of Copper Minerals O,
A Review of the Flotation of Copper Minerals Tinashe O Ndoro,Lordwell K Witika Abstract Copper is most commonly present in the earths crust as copper iron sulphide and copper sulphide minerals,with particular reference to previous studies of refractory copper ore flotation KeywordsExtraction of Copper 4College.co.uk Salters ChemistryThe purpose of the froth floatation is to separate the 0.5% of copper from the 99.5% of “crud”.There are two different types of minerals in the ore at this point; the chalcopyrite is a sulphide,and the rest are silicates containing anions made from silicon and oxygen atoms.In this process,a “collector” is added to a water mineral&nbsp;.

The blend used in this laboratory scale investigation was 70% sulphide ore and 30% oxide ore on a weight basis.The copper sulphides present in the blend were bornite and chalcopyrite,while the oxides were malachite and minor azurite.From previous flotation investigations of mixed copper oxide and sulphide minerals&nbsp;.Copper Sulfide Flotation 911 MetallurgistChanging ore,changing market conditions and many other factors make this flexibility absolutely necessary.A slight change,easily made,in a flexible flowsheet may increase tonnage,improve recovery and lower grinding and reagent costs.

Remember that only 0.67% of the ore is copper.The copper minerals and waste rock are separated at the mill using froth flotation.The copper ore slurry from the grinding mills is mixed with milk of lime (simply water and ground up limestone) to give a basic pH,pine oil (yes,it comes from trees a by product of paper mills)&nbsp;.
