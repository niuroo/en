## Extraction Of Copper Mining,Concentration,…
Copper Mining: The commonest ore used in the extraction of copper is Chalcopyrite (CuFeS 2) also known as Copper Pyrites and other such sulfides.The percentage of copper in the actual ore is too low for direct extraction of copper to be viable.The concentration of ore is required and it is done by the Froth Flotation method.Concentration of Ore:Innovations in Copper: Mining &amp; Extraction: …1&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Three of the processes introduced above have made great strides in solving these problems for the extraction of copper from chalcopyrite: The GEOCOAT™ Process A heap leaching process that is capable of bioleaching copper concentrates.It does this by coating the concentrate slurry onto a support rock,or substrate material,and stacking this coated material in a bioxidation heap.
