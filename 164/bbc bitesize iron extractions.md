## EXTRACTION OF METALS
10&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;EXTRACTION OF METALS Occurrence • ores of some metals are very common (iron,aluminium) • others occur only in limited quantities in selected areas • ores need to be purified before being reduced to the metal this adds to the expense • high grade ores are therefore cheaper to process.Theory The method used depends on the..extraction of titanium17&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Titanium is made by a batch process.In the production of iron,for example,there is a continuous flow through the Blast Furnace.Iron ore and coke and limestone are added to the top,and iron and slag removed from the bottom.This is a very efficient way of making something.With titanium,however,you make it one batch at a time.

## Types of Extraction S cool,the revision website
15&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Methods of extraction Many metals are found in the Earth's crust as ores.An ore is usually a compound of the metal mixed with impurities.When the metal is dug up,a method must be used to separate the metal from the rest of the ore.This is called extracting the metal.The method of extraction depends on how reactive the metal is.The more reactive the metal,the more difficult it is to.Iron Extraction ProcessIron Extraction Process.In the blast furnace process,the first step on the way towards heavy plate,pig iron is produced from iron ore.The composition of the ore and additions is accurately adjusted to the final products of AG der Dillinger H&#252;ttenwerke and Saarstahl AG.

## Mineral Extraction
When disturbed by excavation,pyrite or iron sulfide in the ground weathers and reacts with oxygen and water to produce high levels of iron and sulfate in runoff water.Modern mining operations use lime and other chemicals to treat acidic drainage,but the long term effectiveness of this method is not yet known.extraction of metals15&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;This page looks at the various factors which influence the choice of method for extracting metals from their ores,including reduction by carbon,reduction by a reactive metal (like sodium or magnesium),and by electrolysis.Details for the extraction of aluminium,copper,iron and titanium are.

The iron manufactured in Blast Furnaces contain about 3 4 % of Carbon and smaller quantities of many other impurities such as sulfur,Silicon,etc.This is called Pig Iron.It is a hard but brittle metal and the impurities severely hamper its strength.Carbon seems to play a significant role in influencing the brittleness and hardness.EXTRACTION OF IRON24&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The liquid iron runs downward to the bottom of the furnace and is withdrawn through tap hole.Slag formation : Lime stone on heating decomposes to CaO and CO 2.CaCO 3 CaO + CO 2.CaO now reacts the impurities of ore called GANGUE to form slag.Slag is the mixture of.
