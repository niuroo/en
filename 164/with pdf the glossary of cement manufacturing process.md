## The Cement Manufacturing Process
There are more than twenty types of cement used to make various specialty concrete,however the most common is Portland cement.Cement manufacturing is a complex process that begins with mining and then grinding raw materials that include limestone and clay,to a fine powder,called raw meal,which is then heated to a sintering temperature as.CEMBUREAUCEMBUREAU is the European Cement Association.Our primary audience is Europe both policymakers and their relevant stakeholders.In this regard,we communicate the industry’s views on all technical,environmental,energy and downstream issues and policy developments.
