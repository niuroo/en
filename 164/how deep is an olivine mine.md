Twenty five years ago this month,Thomas Gold published a seminal manuscript suggesting the presence of a “deep,hot biosphere” in the Earth’s crust.Since this publication,a considerable amount of attention has been given to the study of deep biospheres,their role in geochemical cycles,and their potential to inform on the origin of life and its potential outside of Earth.Deep sea mining IUCN• Deep sea mining is the process of retrieving mineral deposits from the deep sea the area of the ocean below 200 m • Depleting terrestrial deposits and rising demand for metals are stimulating interest in the deep sea,with commercial mining imminent • The scraping of the sea floor and pollution from mining processes can wipe out entire species many yet to be discovered

## Olivine Wikipedia
The mineral olivine ( ˈ ɒ l ɪ ˌ v i n ) is a magnesium iron silicate with the chemical formula (Mg 2+,Fe 2+) 2 Si O 4It is a type of nesosilicate or orthosilicateThe primary component of the Earth's upper mantle,it is a common mineral in Earth's subsurface,but weathers quickly on the surface For this reason,olivine has been proposed as a good candidate for accelerated weathering.
