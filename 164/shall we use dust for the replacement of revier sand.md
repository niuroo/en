## Project on Partial Replacement of Cement with Marble …
In this project our main objective is to study the influence of partial replacement of cement with marble powder,and to compare it with the compressive and tensile strength of ordinary M20 concrete.We are also trying to find the percentage of marble powder replaced in concrete that makes the strength of the concrete maximum.www.linguee.com28&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;# Linguee German English Dictionary # Version :: 1.0 2009 # License :: GPL Version 2 or later; GNU General Public License angesteuert auf::headed for drehbar.

Effect of Quarry Dust as Partial Replacement of Sand in The use of quarry dust in concrete is desirable because of its benefits such as useful disposal of by products,reduction of river sand consumption as well as increasing the strength parameters and increasing the workability of concrete (Jain et al,1999)Waste glass powder as partial replacement of cement …Trial mix design were conducted to obtain the target strength of 35 MPa at 28 days with a workability of 100 125 mm as per American Concrete Institute ACI 211.1 (ACI,2009).The glass powder replacement in cement was varied (0 25%).Mix proportion of concrete is shown in Table 6.Firstly,stone chips and sand were dry mixed for a minute.
