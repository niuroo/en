## Preparation of High Percentage α Calcium Sulfate.
α calcium sulfate hemihydrate (α HH) is known to be suitable for application as bone void filler.High percentage of α HH is obviously needed for medical applications,especially for implantation.Three commercially available calcium sulfate dihydrates (DH,CaSO4&#183;2H2O) with different sizes and surface morphologies were used as starting materials to synthesize high percentage α HH via a.CARBONATE EQUILIBRIA26&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Only a small portion of the aqueous carbon dioxide exists as carbonic acid.However,in most H 2 CO 3 * (as defined below) is used to represent solution carbonates.* H 2C O 3 =H 2 C 3 + CO 2(aq) (2) Where H 2 CO 3 * is the total dissolved cabon including aqueous carbon dioxide.Carbonic acid dissociates into bicarbonate and carbonate according.

## Uses for Gypsum Powder Sciencing
Gypsum powder is a natural product derived from the mineral gypsum.It is primarily used to make drywall,but it is also an ingredient in cement and paints.It is used by farmers as a fertilizer and soil conditioner.In the food industry,it is added to improve texture in a variety of products.Possibilities of Alpha Gypsum Preparation in Chloride …The Institute of Building Materials and Elements Technology at the Brno University of Technology,solves in the long term the problem of alpha gypsum preparation by dehydrating the gypsum in the solution of chloride salts.The gypsum dehydrates to alpha hemi hydrate by this method under atmospheric pressure in liquid environment.
