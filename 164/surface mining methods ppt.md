## Equipment Selection for Surface Mining: A Review
19&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;A surface mine contains pits with mineral endowed rock (or ore).We extract ore that lies within the upper layer of the earth,from surface mines (Fricke,2006).This ore can include metals such as iron,copper,coal and gold.There are several methods of surface mining,including open pit,stripping,dredging and mountain top removal.Introduction to the course25&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;INTRODUCTION TO MINING AND METALLURGICAL ENGINEERING Core course (3:3;0) Dr.Hussin Abdelbary Mohamed Ahmed Office : 458 B.2 6 Surface mining methods types,uses and equipments 7 Underground mining methods types,uses and equipments Production cycle in a working mine (CLO 8) 2 8 Introduction to Production cycle or Unit operations in.

## Surface Mining,Industry of Metals,Minerals,Precious.
Surface mining is a form of mining in which the soil and the rock covering the mineral deposits are removed.It is the other way of underground mining,in which the overlying rock is left behind,and the required mineral deposits are removed through shafts or tunnels.Surface mining is basically employed when deposits of commercially viable minerals or rock are found closer to the surface.CHAPTER 11 Mining Technology19&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;the mining technologies currently in use on Federal leases and the potential for commer cial mining technologies to extract Federal coal reserves from deep underground seams.The chapter discusses: three surface mining techniques that are used in the West: 1) area strip,2) open pit,and 3) terrace pit; two methods of underground mining in
