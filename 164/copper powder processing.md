## Study of the processing route of copper powder by.
24&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;In this work the influence of different processing parameters has been studied in order to minimize contaminations in milled pure copper powder.For this reason the influence of the process control agent (none,toluene and stearic acid),ball to powder ratio (BRP,10: 33:1),type of milling cycle (interrupted,continuous) were investigated.Copper Powder by Electrolytic ProcessThe principal methods for producing copper powder is electrolytic deposition at high current densities and the atomization of molten metal.Copper powder is also formed by cementation or by pressured precipitation from acqueous solutions,but such precipitates are of little commercial interest.There is no copper powder manufacturers.
