## The operating principle of the ball mill
The operating principle of the ball mill consists of following steps.In a continuously operating ball mill,feed material fed through the central hole one of the caps into the drum and moves therealong,being exposed by grinding media.The material grinding occurs during impact falling grinding balls and abrasion the particles between the balls.Then,discharge of ground material performed.TECHNICAL AND COMMERCIAL BENEFITS OF GEARLESS …general,the bigger the mill diameter,the lower are the mill operating and critical speeds.Thus,for larger mills the number of poles will increase.As a result,the number of poles can vary from 48 to 72 poles (Fig.3.) with typical mill speed requirements of about 10 rpm for larger SAG mills and about 15 rpm for smaller ball mills.Figure 3.
