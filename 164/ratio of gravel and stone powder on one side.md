## Can portland cement be mixed without sand or gravel.
I'm planning to switch from wood to cement because we are soon moving into a condominium where noise should be kept to a minimum.If yes,what is the ratio of water to cement? if no,can i mix it with sand only and what is the ratio.ThanksConcrete mix ratio for various grades of concrete.It is necessary to maintain consistency in each and every concrete mix prepared during the entire project.It is one of the important job of site engineer supervisor to inspect and enforce it.Water content ratio in concrete mix.Besides water content also largely determine the strength &amp; workability of concrete.

## What Are the Mix Ratios for Cement and Sand? …
The basic mix ratio for concrete is one part water,two parts cement and three parts sand.An alternative ratio is one part cement,two parts sand and three parts gravel with enough water added until the mixtures reaches the consistency of thick mud.Lime is also a common additive to the mix.Test 1 : Standard Slump and Flow Table Tests10&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;As shown in Table 1.1,seven batches were tested for workability and flow.Batch one established the reference slump value for the Kistner mix using the standard ASTM cone test.The water content was adjusted to compensate for the dry gravel and sand used in the lab.The flow table test procedure does not conform with ASTM standard and is as.

## CONCRETE MIXING RATIOS
A concrete mixture ratio of 1 part cement,3 parts sand,and 3 parts aggregate will produce a concrete mix of approximately 3000 psi.Mixing water with the cement,sand,and stone will form a paste that will bind the materials together until the mix hardens.Gravel CalculatorDifferent types of gravel have different densities and by knowing it you can get a more accurate estimate for the amount of gravel you need from our gravel calculator.Gravel is categorized in two main types under the Udden Wentworth scale: granular gravel (2 to 4 mm 0.079 to 0.157 inches) and pebble gravel (5 to 64 mm or 02 to 2.5 inches).

## Concrete Mix Ratios
Concrete mix ratio is a vital topic in concrete mix design.The four basic ingredients for making concrete are: Portland cement,sand,aggregate (stone) and water.The strength of concrete mixture depends on the ratio in which these four ingredients are mixed.A review on the angle of repose of granular materials.Gravel (crushed stone) 45&#176;.The box must contain at least one transparent side; the granular material is placed on the base of the box,and then the box is tilted gradually at a rate of 18&#176; min.The amount (mass) of the powder is specified in the standard (approximately 454 g),and the tested powder should be homogenous and.

Laying a concrete driveway over an existing gravel one is possible,but it is not generally recommended.The kind of gravel that is intended to go under cement is typically a smaller grade than what is used for gravel driveways.However,if the gravel in your driveway is small enough,it is possible to create a cement driveway over the existing.How to Calculate the Angle of Repose SciencingThe angle of repose is the minimum angle at which any piled up bulky or loose material will stand without falling downhill.One way to demonstrate this would be to pour sand from a bag to the ground.There is a minimum angle or maximum slope the sand will maintain due to the forces of gravity and the effect of friction between the particles of.
