## Pulverized coal injection in a blast furnace IspatGuru
Pulverized Coal Injection (PCI) is a process that involves injecting large volumes of fine coal particles into the raceway of a blast furnace (BF).This provides not only a supplemental carbon source but also speeds up the production of liquid iron besides reducing the need for metallurgical coke for reactions in the blast furnace.INJECTION OF PULVERIZED MATERIALS INTO THE BLAST …6&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;furnace (LKAB EBF ) and in industrial BFs shows that tuyere injection is a feasible method for supply of various types of pulverized materials as different types of PC,BOF slag and BF dust to the BF.In this study,the effect on process,raceway conditions,hot metal quality,reductant agent consumption and slag formation due to

## Pulverized Coal in Blast Furnaces
20&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Abstract: Pulverized coal injected into a blast furnace (BF) burns incompletely in a very limited amount of time.A considerable amount of unburned pulverized coal (UPC) escapes from the raceway to the coke layer.The unburned pulverized coal reacts with CO2 in the coke layer,and this has a very signiﬁcant impact on the operation of the BF.Basil R.Paynter and B.P.Huynh12&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;pulverized coal (fuel) carried by air in pipe networks to feed the boiler furnaces of a power station.The pipe network considered consists of four 457mm diameter mill pipes which take the pulverised coal of nominal size 75micron from a coal pulverising mill,to a boiler furnace,with 2 pipes going to its front,and 2 to its back side.
