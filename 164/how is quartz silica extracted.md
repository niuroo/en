SciencingQuartz is extracted from open pit mines.Miners only use explosives on rare occasions when they need to expose a deep seam of quartz.The reason for this is that although quartz is known for its hardness,it damages easily if it is suddenly exposed to a change in temperature,such as that caused by a blast.
