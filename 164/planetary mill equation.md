## Effects of the friction coefficient of a barrel on the.
We investigated the effect of the friction coefficients of a barrel on the grinding performance of multi layer ceramic capacitors (MLCCs) in a planetary ball mill.We formulated the motion equation of the MLCCs,including gravitational force,interactive force due to collisions and the drag force in a planetary ball mill,using the three dimensional discrete element method.The contact model.Effects of the friction coefficient of a barrel on the.22&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;capacitors (MLCCs) in a planetary ball mill.We formulated the motion equation of the MLCCs,including gravitational force,interactive force due to collisions and the drag force in a planetary ball mill,using the three dimensional discrete element method.The contact model in a collision between two MLCCs is represented by the Voigt model.
