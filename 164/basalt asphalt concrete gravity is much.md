## basalt aggregate asphalt mix
The asphalt mix design with gneiss aggregate has good characteristics which meet the technical requirements.But the characteristics of asphalt concrete with basalt aggregates are much better.The idea of increasing 2% of gneiss filler in the F1 formulation is well justified by the increase in Marshall and Duriez characteristics shown in the F2.5 Aggregate Specifications and Requirements2&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;hot mix asphalt and portland cement concrete.The intent is to avoid using highly porous,absorptive aggregates because extra water and cement or.difference in specific gravity of the slag compared to the specific gravity of the natural aggregate.For any pay item less than 500 tons on a contract,no adjustment is made.

## Basalt Crushing Plant Layout and Price
6&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Basalt application.Basalt has the advantages of strong pressure resistance,corrosion resistance,and good asphalt adhesion.It has been internationally recognized as a high quality construction material for roads,railways and airport runways.Basalt is also a good quality aggregate for lightweight concrete in high rise buildings.Specific Gravity Of General Materials TableThe specific gravity of all other materials are compared to water as a fraction heavier or fraction lighter density,no matter how small or large the fraction is.For example,ammonium nitrate has a specific gravity (sg) of 0.73 while dry ammonium sulphate has a sg of 1.13 (1130 kilograms cubic meter).

## Utilization of Gneiss in Asphalt Concrete Mixtures
Construction of the pavement has consumed a huge amount of high grade aggregates,such as basalt,limestone etc.In some region,these aggregates are very scarce and have to be produced and transported from far aggregate quarries which would cause the waste of energy and resources as well as the increase of cost.Large quantities of gneiss exist in China,the use of gneiss as aggregates might.Which Rocks Absorb Heat the Best? HunkerWhen constructing a floor for passive solar use,or using a stone surface to keep bread warm while serving,it is important to know which kind of rock will retain heat the best.The ability to retain heat is a function of the stone's specific heat capacity and density.
