## 36 Reasons for Using Gypsum Holloway Agriculture
Abstract: Agriculture has failed to be sustainable several times in the history of the world because of soil failure (Rush,1987) Irrigated land eventually leads to sodicity and salinity unless extreme care is taken Gypsum is a key ingredient for the maintenance of agriculture on many types of soils and over a wide pH range including sodicity Waste product gypsum is available in a large.GYPSUM IN AGRICULTURE Smart Fertilizer29 09 2020&#0183;&#32;To know whether the crop will respond to gypsum,it is necessary to observe the calcium,aluminum,and base saturation values of the soil test considering 20 40 cm depth (or 8 to 16 inches) If the test shows either low calcium,low base saturation or high aluminum,the use of gypsum is recommended,and should be applied all over the land before planting
