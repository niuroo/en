## Process Flow
Flow process can be defined as follows: Flow process chart sets out the sequence of the flow of a product or an equipment or a man,by recording all the events under review using appropriate process symbols.These flow process charts can either be material type or equipment type or man type,depending whether the subject being charted is the.Ore processing Waihi GoldThe grinding process reduces the rock to a slurry The SAG mill is a large revolving cylinder Rock is ground by the turning action of the mill,and impact from the hardened steel balls and the rock itself In order to ensure that the rock is ground finely enough the SAG mill has a trommel screen (5),which acts like a large sieve
