## Activated Carbon in Gold Cyanidation
Activated carbon is a critical component in the beneficiation of gold ore,allowing this widespread process to occur because of its ability to recover gold from the gold cyanide complex.Depending on the deposit,some silver ores may also be processed via cyanidation.Here too,activated carbon is the catalyst for recovery of this precious metal.Carbon In Pulp Method High Frequency ScreenCompliant with cp2010 version of total organic carbon inspection method and usp32643 system applicability requirements designed for the detection of deionized water with a toc content of 15ppm or less online and offline detection can be switched,Carbon in pulp method high frequency screen.
