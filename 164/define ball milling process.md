## Ball Mill
Ball mills are among the most variable and effective tools when it comes to size reduction of hard,brittle or fibrous materials.The variety of grinding modes,usable volumes and available grinding tool materials make ball mills the perfect match for a vast range of applications.What is End Milling?One such process is end milling.End milling primarily differs from other milling processes due to the type of tooling that is used for abrading a given material.Unlike cutters and drill bits,end mills have cutting teeth on the sides and end of the mill.Additionally,the milling applications for the end mill are unique.

## of ball milling process
High energy ball milling process for nanomaterial synthesis.It is a ball milling process where a powder mixture placed in the ball mill is subjected to high energy collision from the balls.This process was developed by Benjamin and his coworkers at the International Nickel Company in the late of 1960.Grinding in Ball Mills: Modeling and Process Control10&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;the milling process takes place during rotation as a result of the transfer of kinetic energy of the moving grinding media into the grinding product.The design of a ball mill can vary significantly depending on the size,the equipment used to load the starting material (feeders),and the system for discharging the output product.
