## Boron Carbide
Boron carbide is also extensively used as control rods,shielding materials and as neutron detectors in nuclear reactors due to its ability to absorb neutrons without forming long lived radionuclide.As it is a p type semiconductor,boron carbide can be a suitable candidate material for electronic devices that can be operated at high temperatures.Boron Carbide CeramicBoron carbide is one of the hardest and lightest known ceramics.It is formed by hot pressing,so making complicated shapes is difficult.Because the boron 10 isotope will absorb neutrons,boron carbide is an important material
