A relatively high air volume and velocity is required: so power requirements are also high.Higher air velocities will have the following other disadvantages: 1.The wear caused by the product on the pipe is considerably higher therefore this process is NOT suitable for materials which are susceptible to degradation and or are abrasive in.OSHA Technical Manual (OTM) Section III: Chapter 3.Friction losses vary according to ductwork type,length of duct,velocity of air,duct area,density of air,and duct diameter.Air Cleaners.The design of the air cleaner depends on the degree of cleaning required.Regular maintenance of air cleaners increases their efficiency and minimizes worker exposure.

## Vertical axis wind turbine
A vertical axis wind turbine has its axis perpendicular to the wind streamlines and vertical to the ground.A more general term that includes this option is &quot;transverse axis wind turbine&quot; or &quot;cross flow wind turbine.&quot; For example,the original Darrieus patent,US Patent 1835018,includes both options.
