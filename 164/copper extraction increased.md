In fact,this extraction increased from 50% at pH 1 to 85.9% at pH 4,with a small drop to 76% at pH 5,possibly due to the formation of goethite FeOOH (see speciation diagram in Fig.5a).Copper and nickel extraction increased nearly linearly at 1 ≤pH ≤ 5,but this proved to be comparatively lower than zinc and iron extraction.Improving of copper extraction from chalcopyrite by using.&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Results showed that metals extraction increased with increasing of NaCl concentration,APS concentration,leaching temperature (up to 333 K),and L S ratio.During oxidative leaching of sulfide minerals,the occurrence of elemental sulfur layer on particle
