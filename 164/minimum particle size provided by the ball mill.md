## Grinding Down to the Nanoscale with Planetary Ball Mills
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Planetary ball mills are the most commonly used ball mills in laboratories for preparing samples ranging from soft to hard to brittle and fibrous materials.The mill derives its name from the unique kinematics wherein the grinding bowls are mounted on a rotating &quot;sun&quoBall Mill,Grinding Ball Mill Equipment For Sale,Ball Mill.2.According to the particle size of the grinding material,the material is loaded into the cylinder by the hollow shaft of the wet grid ball mill feeding end.When the ball mill cylinder rotates,the grinding body acts on the cylinder liner due to the action of inertia and centrifugal force and friction.It is carried away by the cylinder.

## Micronization of a Soft Material: Air Jet and Micro Ball.
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;A ball mill is also commonly employed for fine grinding.In a ball mill,grinding energy is transferred to materials through media such as balls,rods,pebbles,by moving the mill body.For both types of mills theFeed Size VS Ball Size10&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;A ball diameter that grabs the particle must exceed the particle by 25 times to achieve this semi self locking taper.One can argue the f50 is a more realistic value since balls wear and the average ball size might be closer to half the maximum.Then the multiple would be closer to 13 times the maximum particle size fed to the ball mill.
