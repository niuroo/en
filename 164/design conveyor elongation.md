## Getting more life from roller chain Machine Design
1 May 2011.For drive applications with fewer than 60 teeth on the sprocket,replacement of the chain is suggested when it reaches 1.5% elongation,measured over at least six pitches; however,a longer length of chain allows an even better assessment.(For conveyor applications,chains can be used up to 2%&nbsp;.2.3.7 Take Up The Complete Guide to Chain2.3.7 Take Up.Conveyor chains need proper tension,which is why take up is added to a system.You have to position take up where the chain&#39;s tension will be minimal.If you can remove two links from the chain,the adjusting length of take up is: L = chain pitch + spare length.If you can&#39;t remove links from the chain,use&nbsp;.

The En Masse drag conveyor is not limited to conveying En Masse,there are many applications where the bulk solids capacity that is required or the conveyor configuration isn’t practical,but in a lot of these cases the single chain strand with skeletal flights is a very good and reliable solution for conveying needs.A NEW ERA IN OVERLAND CONVEYOR BELT DESIGNA NEW ERA IN OVERLAND CONVEYOR BELT DESIGN Lawrence K.Nordell Conveyor Dynamics,Inc.It is now possible to design overland and high strength conveyor belts that are substantially.starting tension,(3) elongation and age degradation,and (4) splice.
