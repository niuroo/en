The primary objective of this study is to investigate the effects of cylinder size (150 by 300 mm and 100 by 200 mm) on empirical equations that relate static elastic moduli and compressive strength and static and dynamic elastic moduli of concrete.For the purposes,two sets of one hundred and twenty concrete cylinders,150 by 300&amp;#x2009;mm and 100 by 200&amp;#x2009;mm,were prepared from three.Compressive Strength of Concrete Cube Test,…Compressive strength of concrete cube test provides an idea about all the characteristics of concrete.Cube test results judges proper concreting at site.
