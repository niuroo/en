## Fuzzy Expert System
The differential pressure and motor current of the mill (both depend on coal grindability) are the inputs to the control system.The system has been tested on a pilot plant and on a 1000 MW power station.An expert control system using acoustic signatures from the mill has been developed (Bhaumik et al.2006).The control system relies on a.Advantages Of Electrically Operated Stone Crusher14&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;(2) electricity load test,adjust the amplitude of the electrical control box potentiometer R,gradually increasing from small,its amplitude should be between 1.8 to 2.5 mm,the current at 1.2 amps continuous current amplitude is stable over several hours,normal after opening the gate silo feeding,feeding capacity to observe whether the.

## Milling Machines
J.Carvill,in Mechanical Engineer's Data Handbook,1993.5.4.1 Milling process.Milling machines produce mainly flat surfaces by means of a rotating cutter with multiple cutting edges.The two main types of machine are the horizontal and the vertical spindle.Milling cutters usually have teeth cut on the periphery and or on the end of a disk or cylinder.Current Starting Relays&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Current starting relays are used on single phase,fractional horsepower motors requiring low starting torque.Their main function is to assist in starting the motor.Start and run capacitors can be used in conjunction with current relays to boost both starting and running torque.
