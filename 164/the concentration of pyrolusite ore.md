## Investigation of Chemical and Mineralogical Composition …
2&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The domestic manganese ore extracted in Nikopol and Bolshetokmakskiy deposits has low manganese concentration ( 24%),high phosphorus concentration (0.0.22%) and,hence,a lot of burden.Therefore,the application of domestic ore in direct smelting is impossible without preliminary dressing according to complicated technological schemes [3].The Oxidation Pretreatment of a Sulfidic Refractory …An attempt has been made to study the pretreatment of sulfidic refractory gold ore with pyrolusite.The inﬂuences of various parameters were studied to optimize the conditions.The optimum leaching conditions were pyrolusite gold ore mass ratio of 3.0,H2SO4 concentration of 3.0 M,temperature of 100&#176;C,particle size of 45μm,stirring speed of 200 rpm.
