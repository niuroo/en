## HEAP LEACHING TECHNIQUE in MINING
22&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Heap leaching techniques are briefly addressed in this version of the BREF document but not sufficiently described.The objective of this document is to provide an overall review of: leaching process in mining practice,with special emphasis on available techniquesSilver Mining in HistoryDuring the 1900s,new mining techniques contributed to a massive rise in overall silver production.Breakthroughs included steam assisted drilling,mine dewatering,and improved haulage.Further,advances in mining techniques enhanced the ability to separate silver from other ores and made it possible to handle larger volumes of material.
